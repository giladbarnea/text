## Abstract

Background: Fibromyalgia  (FM)  is  a  rheumatic  condition  and  pain  disorder  that  primarily affects women. It is characterized by chronic and widespread spontaneous musculoskeletal pain and is highly comorbid with other functional somatic disorders, negative physical sensations in various  organs  and  physiological  systems,  chronic  fatigue,  and  impaired  functioning.  FM patients also report relatively high rates of psychiatric disorders, especially stress and mood disorders, as well as cognitive impairments and a general decline in their quality of life. Up to date, no optimal drug or psychological treatment has been found for FM patients. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based therapy are the two recommended and popular psychological treatments for these patients. The present study compares the effectiveness of these interventions in a randomized controlled trial.

CBT is based on the theory that a person's basic belief system about oneself, and the world produces dysfunctional thoughts, which in turn contribute to negative feelings and maladaptive behaviors. The intervention thus includes  an  attempt to change cognitions and behaviors in order to reduce maladaptive emotional responses. When applied to chronic pain, CBT offers mental and physical practices that focus on thought patterns like catastrophizing and negative thoughts about one's ability or future, as well as on behaviors like avoidance. The therapist will also teach the patients to perform exercises (e.g., muscle relaxation ) to calm negative emotions and reduce anxiety . Mindfulness involves 'paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and nonjudgmentally'. It refers to awareness and attention on a moment -to-moment  basis.  The  quality  of  awareness  that  this  intervention  tries  to  promote  includes openness, curiosity, and a non-judgmental attitude, with an emphasis on seeing and accepting things as they are without trying to change them. Our study examined mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) -a  mindfulness protocol that focuses on stress and has been found to be effective  for  patients  suffering  from  chronic  pain.  The  essential  difference  between  the treatments  can  be  summarized  as  follows:  while  CBT  promotes change  in one's pain perception,  Mindfulness  promotes acceptance  of  the  pain  experience.  Studies  regarding  the effectiveness  of  these  approaches  for  FM  patients  indicate  mixed  results,  and  meta-analysis studies that compared the approaches showed an advantage for cognitive behavioral therapies.

To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  there  is  no  study  that  compares  the  two  treatment  methods directly. Moreover, most studies solely examined the outcomes (and not the process) of these interventions, focusing on general changes from pre- to post-intervention. Therefore, not much is known regarding how CBT and MBSR operate for this condition and what mechanisms are responsible for the changes in patient-reported symptoms following treatments. Finally, most of the previous studies used the generic protocols of CBT and MBSR that do not consider the vast cognitive and functional difficulties that FM patients cope with.

Objectives: The  current  study  was  designed  to  bridge  these  gaps  in  research  through  an extensive examination of the effectiveness of CBT and MBSR among FM patients using newly adapted  treatment  protocols  designed  for  FM,  and  based  on  a  variety  of  symptomatic, psychological, and cognitive measures. We expected that the interventions would be beneficial for FM patients, improving symptomatic aspects of FM, as well as the psychological aspects that accompany them, such as depression, perceived stress, and quality of life. As mentioned before, our study was conducted during COVID-19 pandemic, a situation that forced us to adapt the therapeutic interventions to a remote, online platform (using the Zoom app). This transition allowed us to compare the effect of treatments (CBT, MBSR) when delivered face-to-face and online  by  video  conferencing.  Another  objective  of  the  current  study  was  to  examine  the processes underlying CBT and MBSR and identifying the mechanisms responsible for change in  patient  symptoms.  We  focused  on  the  following  potential  mechanisms  of  change:  1) Difficulties  in  emotion  regulation,  2)  Psychological  inflexibility  related  to  pain,  and  3)  Pain catastrophizing. We generally hypothesized that the change in emotion regulation ability, as well the change in pain-related cognitions, would be associated with the change in the outcome variables.

Methods: The study we performed was a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that included 93 FM patients recruited through a large Israeli healthcare  provider ('Maccabi healthcare). The criteria for study inclusion were: 1) a documented clinical diagnosis of FM given by an expert rheumatologist and/or clinical immunologist, 2) age 18 years or older, 3) Hebrew speakers, 4) physical ability to attend MBSR sessions, 5) no serious cognitive impairments, 6) no psychosis, 7) no active suicidality, 8) no substance abuse, 9) no concurrent participation in another clinical study, 10) no concurrent participation in another mindfulness-based/cognitive behavioral group

therapy, 11) insured by 'Maccabi' health care . Our study examined specific adjustments to the basic protocols of CBT and MBSR in accordance with the specific needs and characteristics of FM. Thus, we carefully adapted the standard protocols to address the symptoms of this condition more appropriately (e.g., emphasis on chronic pain, sleep, female gender-related characteristics, physical appearance, and movement), as well as patients' abilities (e.g., shorter exercises, more gradual  processes).  Our  protocol  included  10  (1.5  hour)  group  sessions.  The  CBT  treatment protocol includes psychoeducation, work  on maladaptive thinking schemes  regulation techniques, and active daily activities planning to relieve pain and overcome avoidance. The MBSR treatment protocol includes psychoeducation and discussions about pain, stress and its effects and the application of mindfulness in everyday situations, in addition to mindfulness practices  such  as  body  scanning,  conscious  communication  and  focus  on  breathing.  In  both treatments, homework was given between the meetings. Following a comprehensive screening process, the participants were randomized into 3 groups -CBT, MBSR, and a waitlist control group  (with  delayed  allocation  to  treatment  post-waitlist).  The  study  included  these  three measurements: pre-intervention,  post-intervention,  and  4-month  follow  up.  The  participants completed self-report questionnaires assessing the following primary outcome measures: FM, health-related quality of life, perceived stress, and major depression. Additionally, we assessed factors hypothesized to serve as change mechanisms in treatment: : psychological inflexibility in pain, pain catastrophizing, and difficulties in emotion regulation.

Results: In general, our findings reflect the therapeutic potential of MBSR and CBT for FM patients. In addition, MBSR was found to be more effective in comparison to CBT. Patients who received  MBSR  reported  significant  improvement  in  FM  symptoms,  depression,  perceived stress,  and  health-related  quality  of  life,  compared  to  patients  in  the  WL  control  group. Regarding CBT, improvements were observed in FM symptoms and the physical aspect of quality of life, compared to patients in the WL control group. These improvements occurred after a 10-week intervention and were stable after 4 months, expect for HRQOL in the MBSR group. Moreover, while the comparison between CBT delivered face-to-face, CBT delivered by ZOOM, and the WL control group showed slightly higher therapeutic potential for face-to-face therapy, MBSR delivered by ZOOM was found to be more effective than both MBSR delivered

face-to-face, and the WL control group. It is important to note that when examining the trend of the follow-up results of the two MBSR groups, we found that while in the group that underwent face-to-face treatment, the relief of symptoms continued after 4 months, while in the group that underwent  online  treatment,  the  symptoms  stabilized  and  even  worsened.  Additionally,  the results of the study indicate a differential role for the change mechanisms examined in relation to both treatments and the various outcome measures. Our findings show that the change in psychological inflexibility in pain was most strongly associated with CBT outcome, while the change in pain catastrophizing was most strongly associated with MBSR outcome. The results of  this  study  indicate  that  difficulty  in  emotional  regulation  played  a  less  significant  role  in relation to the two treatments. Finally, the results show that the outcome measure most strongly associated with our chosen mechanisms of change was perceived stress.

Discussion :  The  current  study  is  the  first  to  compare  two  psychological  interventions,  with different therapeutic rationales, for FM patients. This study highlights the potential of MBSR (face-to-face  and  online)  to  treat  conditions  that  are  characterized  by  dominant  mind-body aspects. This study also contributes to a deeper understanding of the effectiveness of CBT and MBSR for FM patients by creating an adequate protocol for this condition, and by examining a wide variety of symptomatic, psychological, and cognitive aspects. In addition, the study sheds light on the therapeutic components that may play a role in treatment outcome. It appears that the capacity to accept one's distress, rather than fight it, is highly important for FM. Moreover, it  seems  that  when  the  patient  manages  to  show  greater  flexibility  in  the  face  of  pain,  and especially when she manages to relate to it in a less catastrophic or reactive manner, the more her mental health improves following treatment.

## Introduction

FM is a condition characterized by a complex clinical picture that includes physical and mental aspects that cause great distress (Häuser et al., 2015). This study will try to expand the knowledge  about  the  condition,  its  common  treatment  methods  effectiveness  and,  their mechanisms of action.

Over the years, a variety of treatments for FM have been offered by both pharmacology and psychotherapy. Nevertheless, an effective long-term treatment that fully addresses the spectrum of symptoms associated with FM has still not been found (Calandre, Rico-Villademoros, &amp; Slim, 2015;  Glombiewski et al., 2010).  Furthermore, despite the  scope of literature concerning the effects of individual interventions such as CBT and mindfulness-based interventions (MBI) on FM patients, there are few studies comparing the two in this regard. Thus, to fill these gaps in research knowledge and provide data to help determine the most suitable treatment method for FM patients, we performed an RCT (randomized control trail)  comparing the two treatments. In addition, our study had the opportunity to compare videoconference and face-to-face therapy in both of the therapeutic approaches.

Additionally, research is lacking regarding the underlying mechanisms of change by which psychological treatments operate among rheumatic patients. In our study, we will explore the mechanisms of change of MBSR and CBT. We will focus particularly on pain-related cognition (Psychological  Inflexibility  in  Pain,  Pain  Catastrophizing)  and  emotion  regulation  strategies which studies have linked to coping with FM (Angarita -Osorio et al., 2020; Geenen et al., 2012; Maurel Calvo, Sáez-Francàs, Alegre, &amp; Castro-Marrero, 2020; van Middendorp et al., 2008; Sayer, Gulec, &amp; Topbas, 2004).

For the present study, we have created newly amended treatment protocols for MBSR and CBT that are designed to suit the unique characteristics and difficulties of FM. We hope this study will enable the vast examination of MBSR and CBT effectiveness and the subsequent creation of a suitable protocol for these patients.

## 1. Fibromyalgia

FM  is  a  rheumatic  condition,  characterized  by  chronic  and  widespread  spontaneous musculoskeletal pain, as well as chronic headaches, sore throats, visceral pain, sensory hyperresponsiveness,  and  a  wide  variety  of  symptoms  with  no  obvious  tissue  pathology.  The American  College  of  Rheumatology  (ACR,  1990)  criteria  also  included  a  demonstration  of tenderness. Recently revised diagnostic criteria have delegated the symptom of tenderness to a list of frequent symptoms that include fatigue, lack of refreshing sleep, cognitive impairments, memory deficits,  abdominal  discomfort,  and  headache  (Clauw,  2014;  Glass,  2009;  Wolfe  &amp; Hawley, 1998; Wolfe et al., 2011). FM is a common pain disorder that primarily affects women. It  is  highly comorbid with other functional somatic disorders, stress, and depression (Wolfe, Ross, Anderson, Russell, &amp; Hebert, 1995). Unfortunately, at this time, there is no highly effective medical treatment for this condition (Häuser et al., 2015; Thieme, Mathys, &amp; Turk, 2017).

The definition of FM as an autoimmune condition is controversial (Buskila &amp; Sarzi-Puttini, 2008). FM is prevalent in autoimmune diseases, and some FM patients display autoimmunity dysfunction; thus, there is speculation that FM is, in fact, an autoimmune disorder (Buskila &amp; Sarzi-Puttini, 2008). However, reports on immunological markers in FM are inconsistent, and there is no evidence regarding the inflammatory mechanisms in this syndrome. Currently, an FM diagnosis is mostly based on exclusion -meaning that other disorders are ruled out before FM is suggested (Sabik, 2012). While a distinct cause or pathology has not been identified, recent research has indicated that FM patients experience pain differently from the general population because  of  dysfunctional  pain  processing  in  the  central  nervous  system  (Abeles,  Pillinger, Solitar, &amp; Abeles, 2007). Furthermore, being diagnosed with FM is not an easy task. From the first time a patient presents their FM symptoms to a physician, the mean time to receiving an actual  diagnosis  of  FM  is  2.3  years.  The  average  number  of  physicians  to  whom  patients presented their symptoms before receiving a diagnosis of FM is 3.7, with 38% of patients having presented to more than three physicians (Choy et al., 2010).

Pharmacological treatment of the disorder has proved difficult, but central nervous agents such  as  tricyclic  antidepressants  (Heymann,  Helfenstein,  &amp;  Feldman,  2001)  and  selective serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (Arnold et al., 2005; Russell et al., 2008) have been found to be moderately successful for relatively short periods of time (Crofford, 2001). Only a

few non-pharmacological interventions have appeared to confer moderate benefits, including cardiovascular  exercise,  CBT,  patient  psychoeducation  (Goldenberg,  Burckhardt,  &amp;  Crofford, 2004), or a combination of these (Häuser, Bernardy, Arnold, Offenbächer, &amp; Schiltenwolf ,2009).

## 2. Stress, Stress-Related Medical Conditions, and Psychological Interventions

FM is known to be a stress-related condition. Stressful events are thought to influence the pathogenesis  of  physical  diseases  by  prompting  negative  affective  states  (e.g.,  feelings  of anxiety and depression), which affect biological processes or behavioral patterns that, in turn, influence disease risk (Cohen, Kessler, &amp; Gordon, 1995). Exposure to chronic stress is deemed especially toxic since it has the highest likelihood of resulting in long-term or even permanent changes in the emotional, physiological, and behavioral responses that influence the course of the physical disease (Cohen, Janicki-Deverts, &amp; Miller, 2007;Cohen, Kessler, &amp; Gordon, 1995; Marin et al.,2011; McEwen, 1998).

An  important  pathway  between  stressors  and  disease  risk  is  created  by  the  behavioral changes that develop as  adaptations or coping responses to stressors (i.e., sleep disruptions, worse adherence to medical regimens, and decreased exercise) (Cohen, Kessler, &amp; Gordon, 1995; McEwen,  1998).  Stressor-elicited  endocrine  response  provides  another  key  pathway.  Two endocrine response systems are particularly reactive to psychological stress: the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenocortical  axis  (HPA)  and  the  sympathetic-adrenal-medullary  (SAM)  system. Prolonged or repeated activation of the HPA and SAM systems can interfere with their control of  other  physiological  systems,  resulting  in  an  increased  risk  for  physical  and  psychiatric disorders (Cohen, Kessler, &amp; Gordon, 1995; McEwen, 1998). Additionally, the impact of stress on the regulation of immune and inflammatory processes can influence depression, anxiety, pain, and both infectious and autoimmune diseases (Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 2002).

## 2.1. Stress and Rheumatic Diseases

Rheumatic conditions such as FM are commonly referred to as stress-related conditions. They are painful  and often disabling conditions that are  enhanced  and maintained by stress (Conversano et al., 2019; Hassett &amp; Clauw, 2010; Sangha, 2000). Several studies have reported an increased risk of developing an anxiety disorder among patients with arthritis (Watad et al.,

2017), FM (Buskila &amp; Cohen, 2007), Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (Roberts et al., 2017), and more.  Additionally,  patients  with  rheumatic  illnesses have  shown  alterations  in  the  stressresponse  and  dysfunction  in  the  immune  system  (Kojima  et  al.,  2009).  Rheumatic  patients frequently note the occurrence of stressful or traumatic life events either prior to the onset of their illness or in relation to the onset (Hassett &amp; Clauw, 2010). This is especially true for FM, where studies have shown a high incidence of traumatic events prior to the condition's onset (Cohen et al., 2002; Häuser et al., 2019). However, the question of whether stress is the cause or outcome  of  rheumatic  conditions  (or  both)  has  yet  to  be  fully  answered.  The  presumed underlying mechanisms of these associations among rheumatic diseases include stress-related changes in functioning of the autonomic, neuroendocrine, and/or immune systems (Hassett &amp; Clauw, 2010), as well as psychological factors such as anxiety, depression and catastrophizing (Pinto et al, 2023).

## 2.2. Stress and Chronic Pain Conditions

Since chronic pain is a central feature of FM, we will now address its general association with  stress.  Chronic  pain  has  been  particularly  associated  with  high  levels  of  stress.  An estimated one in three people suffer from chronic pain, a condition frequently associated with decreased health-related quality of life and increased levels of psychological distress (Abdallah, &amp; Geha, 2017; National Center for Health Statistics, 2006; Timmers et al., 2019).

Conventional  treatments  manage  to  help  only  a  portion  of  chronic  pain  patients, unfortunately, almost half of the patients report that their pain is not under control, reflecting the complexity of these conditions (Rosenzweig et al., 2010). Limitations of drug therapy for chronic pain also indicate the complex pathophysiology of these conditions and the profound contribution of psychosocial factors to the perpetuation of pain and suffering (Keefe et al., 2004).

There is abundant evidence supporting the implication of psychological treatments for chronic pain conditions (Morley, Williams, &amp; Eccleston, 2013). Psychological treatments are also  used  for  autoimmune  diseases  (Glombiewski  et  al.,  2010;  Fiest  et  al.,  2016).  These psychological  interventions  include  hypnosis  (Torem  et  al.,  2007),  bio-feedback training (Buckelew  et  al.,  1998),  and  cognitive  behavioral  therapies,  which  have  received  the  most impressive empirical support (Hadley &amp; Novitch, 2021; Morley, Eccleston, &amp; Williams, 1999) .

A significant  development  in  the  field  of  cognitive  behavioral  therapies  includes  the  "third wave", a mind-body interventions, which appear to be very useful with stress-related conditions such  as  rheumatic  conditions  and  chronic  pain  (Astin,  2004;  Broderick,  2000).  Mindfulness meditation,  one  of  the  predominant  mind-body  interventions  practiced  today,  has  gained momentum  as  an  accepted  form  of  'third  wave'  psychotherapy  (Chiesa  &amp;  Serretti,  2011). Mindfulness research and the clinical use of mindfulness as  a therapeutic intervention have increased in recent years, and the results have been promising in a range of medical populations (Henke &amp; Chur-Hansen, 2014; Horesh, Glick, Taub, Agmon-Levin, &amp; Shoenfeld, 2017).

In  our  study  we  chose  to  compare  CBT  and  MBSR,  the two  popular  and  promising psychological treatments for FM patients. The next section discuss the various treatments, their development and studies that examined its effectiveness among the population of patients with chronic pain and FM.

## 3. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy

The history of CBT can be divided into three different 'waves' (Hayes, 2004). According to this conceptualization, each of the waves refers to different aspects of the fields of cognition and behavior in psychological therapy.

The  'first  wave' of  CBT  included  the  behavioral  treatment  approach  (behavioristic). Behavioral therapy developed from the traditions of the learning theory developed by Pavlov (1927), Thorndike (1931) and Skinner (1953). These researchers generated and studied models of learning among animals in order to expand the understanding of the developmental processes of psychopathology. The early behavioral theorists believed that associations between stimuli and responses lead to the acquisition of maladaptive behaviors that underlie psychopathology (Watson &amp; Rayner, 1920). The clinical treatment according to this approach includes the use of classical  and  operant  conditioning  techniques,  behavioral  training,  and  exposure  therapy (Newman, LaFreniere, &amp; Shin, 2017).

The " second wave " includes interventions derived from Aron Beck's theory (Beck, 1979). This approach was developed in the 1960-1970s and is based on principles of the behavioral approach  that  came  before  it.  The  innovations  of  cognitive  theory  went  beyond  behavioral theory to place great emphasis on the attempt to identify and change maladaptive cognitions.

This theory assumes that a person's basic belief system about himself and the world can produce dysfunctional thoughts, which in turn contribute to negative feelings and maladaptive behaviors (Beck, 1979).

The  therapy  includes  an  attempt  to  identify  maladaptive  thoughts  and  beliefs  and  to understand their effect on various symptoms. Beck hypothesized that cognitive change would lead to the relief of emotional distress and the change of maladaptive behaviors (Beck, 1979). The central technique in the treatment works through two channels: first, by identifying and monitoring negative and maladaptive thought patterns and their  reconstruction, and second, through  behavioral  interventions -such  as  exposure,  response  prevention,  etc. -aimed  at interrupting the vicious circle between negative cognitive biases and the behavioral consequences  (Bennett  &amp;  David  Nelson,  2006).  A  central  part  of  the  treatment  focuses  on identifying  the  thoughts,  predictions,  beliefs,  behavioral  reactions,  physical  sensations,  and emotions experienced by the patient in moments of distress, with the aim of characterizing the patient's  reactions  to  such  situations.  In  fact,  this  method  tries  to  promote new  learning experiences. The common techniques used in this treatment to do so include psychoeducation, self-monitoring, cognitive re-construction, exposure in imagination/reality, relaxation, reduction  of  maladaptive  behaviors  and  avoidance,  behavioral  activation,  and  more.  The general features of these principles are maintained when applied in the context of group therapy (the subject of the present study), with the addition of important elements like sharing with other group  members,  providing  mutual  feedback  after  experiences  of  exposure  and  symptom monitoring, and mutual encouragement/motivation from the group. Beck's hypothesis (1979) asserts that each form of psychopathology can be characterized by negative cognitive schemas. As  a result, different cognitive-behavioral-based  models  were  developed  for  different psychopathologies. Each of these models attempts to explain the salient symptoms of specific disorders through the identification of cognitions, behaviors, and physiological responses that influence each other and are maintained through cognitive processes (i.e., attention, interpretations, memory, and evaluation).

Various and extensive studies have shown the effectiveness of CBT for different disorders, including  depression,  post-traumatic  stress  disorder,  social  anxiety,  generalized  anxiety,

obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and more (Hofmann, Asnaani, Vonk, Sawyer, &amp; Fang, 2012).

The ' third  wave ' of  cognitive  behavioral  therapy  presents  a  more  contextual  approach compared to previous waves. This approach attempts to elicit acceptance of the psychological experience rather than change or adjust how patients perceive it, as second wave therapists try to do. In recent years, methods associated with the "third wave" of CBT (e.g., Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, Dialectical behavior therapy, mindfulness) have been empirically tested. These  methods  began  to  develop  mainly  in  the  1990s  and  include  therapeutic  models  and theories that emphasize the principles of non-judgmental acceptance of thoughts and the overall experience,  without  attempting  to  resist  or  change  them  (Herbert  &amp;  Forman,  2011).  These methods will be explained in detail in the section describing the mindfulness approach.

## 3.1 CBT Studies among FM Patients

CBT for  pain  is  based  on  the  gate  control  theory  of  pain  and  the  principles  of  operant conditioning treatment (Bennett &amp; Nelson, 2006). The gate control theory of pain, published in 1965 (Melzack, 1996), states that when a stimulus gets sent to the brain, it must first travel to three locations within the spinal cord. These include the cells within the substantia gelatinosa in the dorsal horn, the fibers in the dorsal column, and the transmission cells in the dorsal horn (Ropero Peláez &amp; Taniguchi, 2016). The substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord's dorsal horn serves to modulate the signals that get through, acting like a 'gate' for information traveling to the brain (Trachsel, Munakomi, &amp; Cascella, 2022). The sensation of pain that an individual feels is the result of an interaction of these three components of the spinal cord. Simply stated, when the 'gate' closes, the brain does not receive the information that is coming from the periphery to the spinal cord. However, when the signal traveling to the spinal cord reaches a certain level of intensity, the 'gate' opens and a signal can travel to the brain where it is processed, and as a result, the individual feels pain. The information mentioned above accounts for the physical component  of  pain,  but  the  Gate  Control  Theory  acknowledge  that  psychological  factors contributed to pain as well. Thus, in addition to the control provided by the substantia gelatinosa, there  is  an  additional  control  mechanism  located  in  cortical  regions  of  the  brain  that  are responsible for the effects of cognitive and emotional factors on the pain experienced  (Ropero

Peláez &amp; Taniguchi, 2016). Therefore, negative feelings and thoughts can amplify the intensity of the signals sent to the brain as well (Garland, 2012). For example, somebody who is anxious has  a  'gate'  that  is  open  more  often,  allowing  more  signals  to  get  through,  increasing  the probability  that  an  individual  will  experience  pain  from  an  otherwise  normal  stimulus. Accordingly,  the  CBT  model  for  pain  assumes  that  a  recognition  of  emotion,  behavior, cognition, as well as the physical and sensory aspects of pain is significant in understanding the patient's  experience  of  pain .  The  model  states  that  this  understanding  is  necessary  when analyzing the impact of the patient's personal beliefs regarding pain on their own distress. The goal  of  pain-focused  CBT  is  to  reduce  maladaptive  emotional  responses  to  pain  and  its accompanying  symptoms  through  cognitive  and  behavioral  change  techniques  (Bradley  &amp; Alberts, 1999; Keefe et al., 2005). Common techniques in this treatment include increasing the patient's belief in t heir control over the pain, reducing maladaptive thoughts in relation to the pain, and improving the daily function that was undermined by the pain experience (Bennett &amp; Nelson, 2006).

CBT for chronic pain has been applied and studied for many years (Bennett &amp; Nelson, 2006). Therefore, this treatment is one of the two most common non-pharmacological treatments for FM (Goldenberg, Burckhardt, &amp; Crofford, 2004). In a meta-analysis study that examined 23 RCT studies for FM, it was reported that CBT leads to the best results in reducing the intensity of pain in the short term and in alleviating sleep difficulties associated with FM. In addition, CBT has been  proven  to  reduce  negative  mood  or  depression  symptoms  associated  with  the  FM, improving patients' daily functioning, ability to cope with pain, overall well-being, immune system functioning, increase brain efficiency and biological mechanisms that produce pain as well as increasing their general hope for improvement in their health (Bennett &amp; Nelson, 2006; Lazaridou et al., 2017; Seminowicz et al., 2017; Thieme, Flor, &amp; Turk, 2006). A recent systematic review conducted by Heller and collegues (2021) showed CBT for FM improved pain processing and daily activities by decreasing patient's limitations, such as morning stiffness. When CBT was  compared  to  conventional  pharmacological  therapy,  a  certain  superiority  of  CBT  was observed concerning the quality of life, catastrophizing, and acceptance of pain. Furthermore, CBT found to help to normalize pain-related brain responses in FM (Lazaridou et al., 2017).

In the current study, a unique protocol of group CBT for FM was constructed. The protocol is based on the conclusions of studies that show the effectiveness of CBT for chronic pain and FM (Bernardy, Füber, Köllner, &amp; Häuser, 2010; Glombiewski et al., 2010; Thorn &amp; Kuhajda, 2006; Vallejo, Ortega, Rivera, Comeche , &amp; Vallejo-Slocker, 2015).

## 4. Mindfulness

Mindfulness  involves  'paying  attention  in  a  particular  way:  on  purpose,  in  the  present moment, and nonjudgmentally' (Kabat -Zinn, 1994, p.4). It refers to the cultivation of conscious awareness and attention on a moment-to-moment basis. The awareness sought by mindfulness practice includes openness or receptiveness, curiosity, and a non-judgmental attitude with an emphasis placed on seeing and accepting things as they are without trying to change them.

Mindfulness originated in ancient eastern and Buddhist philosophies and dates back about 2,500  years.  Mindfulness  meditation  is  one  of the  most  important  elements  of  the  Buddha's 'noble eightfold path' to end suffering and instill wisdom. Principally, mind fulness in Buddhist teaching is viewed as a fundamental pathway to becoming aware of the causes and sources of suffering and to attain enlightenment or an awakening. As a result, individuals can become less egoistical and to obtain insight into the state o f 'non -self.' According to Buddhism, when an individual has truly acquired complete enlightenment or insight into the 'non -self,' they will have achieved full freedom of the mind (Xiao, Yue, He, &amp; Yu, 2017).

The Buddhist concept 'sati' was first translated in 1881 from Pali as 'mindfulness' by a British scholar of the Pali language, Thomas William Rhys Davids, based on his understanding of the Mahasatipatthana Sutta, and especially on the practice of watching how things 'come to be' and how they 'pass away' (Gethin, 2011). Through the process of mindfulness, one is able to dissociate from the contents of consciousness (i.e., one's thoughts) and view one's moment -by-moment experience with greater clarity and objectivity. Such a shift in perspective is labeled as 're -perceiving' by Shapiro and colleagues (2006), who found that this is the predominant methodology of mindfulness in therapy.

Mindfulness  practice  has  been  found  to  be  effective  in  treating  a  variety  of  medical conditions, where  patients'  distress  stems  from  the  intrusive  nature  of  their  pain  and  their subsequent difficulties in daily functioning (Kabat-Zinn, 1982; Kabat-Zinn, Lipworth, Burncy,

&amp; Sellers, 1986; Morone, Greco, &amp; Weiner, 2008). A meta-analysis conducted by Astin (2004) on mind-body therapies categorized mindfulness meditation as a 'promising MBT  for heterogeneous pain but [one that] has yet to be adequately tested with randomized controlled trials'  (Astin,  2004,  p.30).  In  later  sections  of  this dissertation,  we  will  elaborate  further  on mindfulness and its specific clinical applications among our study population.

The field of mindfulness includes a variety of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs), the most well-known and evidence-based of which are mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and  mindfulness-based  cognitive  therapy  (MBCT).  MBCT  was  originally  designed  to  treat depression  (Teasdale  et  al.,  2000),  but  has  been  applied  to  a  variety  of  medical  populations (Fitzpatrick, Simpson, &amp; Smith, 2010) and psychiatric disorders (Chiesa, &amp; Serretti, 2011). MBSR is of particular interest for treating FM since it has been primarily recognized for reducing stress (Grossman, Niemann, Schmidt, &amp; Walach, 2004). Considering that FM is defined as a stressrelated disorder, MBSR seems more suitable for treatment of this disease than MBCT, which is less focused on stress reduction per-se.

## 4.1 Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR)

Mindfulness-Based  Stress  Reduction  (MBSR)  was  developed  at  the  University  of Massachusetts Medical Center in 1979 by Jon Kabat-Zinn as an intervention to relieve stress and better cope with illness (Kabat-Zinn, 2003). MBSR is now being offered at many health care institutions in the U.S. and Europe (Santorelli, 1999). In its original version, MBSR is an eightweek program in mindfulness training. The standard program has weekly group sessions for 2 -2.5 hours and one full-day session after six or seven weeks (Kabat-Zinn, 1990). Weekly sessions have  standardized  core  elements  consisting  of  different  mental  and  physical  mindfulness exercises: 1) body-scan exercises (paying close attention to all body parts from the feet to the head), 2) mental exercises (focusing one's attention on breathing), 3 ) physical exercises (being aware of bodily sensations and one's own limits during the exercises), and 4) practicing being fully aware during everyday activities by using breathing as an anchor for attention. Developing an  accepting,  non-reactive  attitude  is  essential  to  all  parts  of  the  program.  The  intervention derives its roots from ancient Buddhist practices of Vipassana (insight) meditation and Yoga exercises; however, it has been adapted using Western terminology and is free of any religious

affiliation (Kabat-Zinn, 1990). In addition to the exercises, there are information sessions and discussions  on  stress,  stress  management,  and  how  to  apply  mindfulness  to  interpersonal communication. In each session, group members are provided with time to discuss and reflect together on their experiences when practicing mindfulness. In between sessions, participants are  strongly  encouraged  to  practice  the  exercises  daily  for  30-45  minutes  by  listening  to audiotapes with guided exercises on body-scanning, sitting mindfulness, breathing, and yoga stretching. MBSR is deemed effective once patients develop increased awareness to what is occurring in each moment with an accepting attitude (i.e., without getting caught up in automatic and habitual thoughts, emotions, and behavior patterns). This increased awareness allows for new  coping  mechanisms  and  healthier  ways  of  responding  to  personal  and  environmental situations.

MBSR has been widely studied (Grossman et al., 2004). This intervention has been used to treat populations with a variety of mental disorders (e.g., anxiety, depression, attention deficit disorder; Haller, Breilmann, Schröter, Dobos, &amp; Cramer, 2021; Lee et al., 2020; Oliva et al., 2021) as well as chronic physical illnesses (e.g., heart disease, cancer, epilepsy; Tedder, Shi, Si, Franco, &amp;Chen, 2015; Walker, Obolensky, Dini, &amp;Thompson, 2010; Würtzen et al., 2013). It was found to have extensive effects on biological processes as well, as it was associated with reduced cortisol levels and blood pressure, as well as with an increased number of white blood cells (Matousek, Dobkin, &amp; Pruessner, 2010). All these factors are stress-related indicators (Carlson, Speca, Faris, &amp; Patel, 2007).

## 4.2 MBSR Studies among FM Patients

There  is  conflicting  evidence  regarding  whether  MBSR  is  effective  in  treating  FMassociated symptoms (Astin et al., 2003; Fjorback et al., 2013; Grossman et al., 2007). A recent review  detected  inadequate  evidence  for  MBSR  in  FM  patients  (Lauche,  Cramer,  Dobos, Langhorst,  &amp;  Schmidt,  2013).  On  the  one  hand,  studies  have  examined  MBSR  among  FM patients and have pointed to its effectiveness in improving physical symptoms, depression, pain, quality of life,  and fatigue (Astin et al., 2003; Fjorback et al., 2013; Goldenberg et al., 1994; Grossman, Tiefenthaler-Gilmer, Raysz, &amp; Kesper, 2007; Pérez-Aranda et al., 2019; Schmidt et al., 2011; Sephton et al., 2007). On the other hand, the effects that were found were inconsistent

in follow-up measurements (Lauche, Cramer, Dobos, Langhorst, &amp; Schmidt, 2013), and there are studies  that  found  non-significant  effects  to  the  reported  measures  (Fjorback  et  al.,  2013; Schmidt et al., 2011).  It is important to notice that the control groups of these studies differed widely, some studies used a wait-list (WL) or treatment as usual control group (Fjorback et al., 2013; Goldenberg et al., 1994; Schmidt et al., 2011; Sephton et al., 2007), while others applied an educational support group (Astin et al., 2003), or an active control procedure  (Grossman et al., 2007; Schmidt et al., 2011). In addition to the differentiation in control group, there were also issues with reporting the results. Only a few of the RCTs reported adequate randomization and allocation  concealment  (Astin  et  al.,  2003;  Fjorback  et  al.,  2013;  Schmidt  et  al.,  2011). Importantly, only one study examined the mechanisms of change of MBSR (Pérez-Aranda et al., 2019). In addition, most of the studies reported here examined the short-term effectiveness of MBSR (examining the changes from pre- to post-intervention). Few studies examined longterm  effectiveness  6  months  (Goldenberg  et  al.,  1994)  or  15  months  after  the  intervention (Fjorback et al., 2013).

## 5. Comparison between CBT and MBSR for FM

In recent years, researchers have become interested in comparing psychological treatments for  FM.  There  is  currently  no RCT studies that compare second wave cognitive behavioral treatment methods to those from the third wave regarding effectivity for FM directly. To date, this comparison has involved conducting meta-analysis studies comparing effect sizes found for the different treatment approaches in separate studies. The results of these studies indicate a preference for cognitive behavioral treatments from  the second  wave  over  relaxation interventions,  educational  interventions,  behavioral  treatments  (including  mainly  operant interventions), and mindfulness-based treatments (Glombiewski et al., 2010). Furthermore, the authors  point  to  methodological  difficulties  in  studies  that  examined  mindfulness-based approaches for the treatment of FM (Lami, Martinez, &amp; Sanchez, 2013). In addition, these studies emphasize the need to examine and compare the therapeutic mechanisms and their suitability for  FM  patients  to  formulate  interventions  that  can  properly  address  the  psychological  and physiological complexity of this disorder (Glombiewski et al. 2010). Although it is currently impossible to find information on a direct comparison of the approaches, it is possible to find

information  regarding  their  respective  effectiveness  in  treating  the  main  symptoms  and difficulties  from  which  FM  patients  suffer.  Thus,  for  example,  studies  that  compared  the effectiveness of CBT and mindfulness-based therapy found that both approaches are equally effective for treating depression (Omidi, Mohammadkhani, Mohammadi, &amp; Zargar, 2013), pain (Cherkin et al., 2016), and anxiety (Arch et al., 2013).

This comparison is particularly interesting considering how different these two treatment modules are in terms of their philosophy. While one actively encourages modifying thoughts and  correcting  cognitions  categorized  as  erroneous  and  irrational,  the  other,  in  almost paradoxically, emphasizes acceptance of negative feelings and thoughts without any attempt to change or fight them. The current study will be, to our knowledge, the first to conduct such a direct comparison.

## 6. Internet Based Psychological Therapy for FM

As mentioned before, our study was conducted during COVID-19 pandemic, a situation that forced us to adapt the therapeutic interventions to a remote, online platform (using the Zoom app).  This  transition  allowed  us  to  compare  the  effect  of  treatments  (CBT,  MBSR)  when delivered face-to-face and online by video conferencing.

Although nonpharmacologic approaches have been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of FM patients, they are less likely to be used in clinical settings. These treatments are limited by inadequate access to qualified therapists, difficulty paying for treatments, a lack of physician awareness,  or  time  constraints  in  implementing  nonpharmacologic  approaches.  The  patient burden associated with traveling to and from therapy may be another barrier (Menga et al., 2014).

Web-based therapies avoid many of these issues. The appeal of this approach lies in (1) reduced  wait-list  times  and  subsequent  ease  and  speed  of  accessibility,  (2)  flexibility  for individual schedules, (3) the ability for participants to work at their own pace in the comfort of their own homes, and (4) reduced cost (Andersson &amp; Titov, 2014).

Online  groups  can  be  divided  into  two  categories:  synchronic  groups  (in  which  every participant is online at the same time) and asynchronic groups (in which participants can connect to the group at different times). Although the synchronic groups can be based on text alone, usually  they  are  video  conferences,  using  platforms  that  allow  for  both  audio  and  video

communication (e.g., Zoom, Vsee, Doxy). The asynchronic groups usually use Internet forums (e.g., Google groups), although they can also use instant message platforms (e.g., WhatsApp), and are based on text messages only (Weinberg, 2020). There is evidence that the quality of the research on asynchronous therapy is not high, whereas quality of research for synchronously provided therapy is good (Varker, Brand, Ward, Terhaag, &amp; Phelps, 2019).

Different studies have examined the effect of internet-based treatment for chronic pain. In a review conducted by Macea, Gajos, Calil, &amp; Fregni (2010), 11 randomized control studies were assessed to quantify the efficacy of internet-based CBT (iCBT) with a specific focus on chronic pain. This meta-analysis found small reductions in pain compared to wait-list control groups. In another  review  (Bender,  Radhakrishnan,  Diorio,  Englesakis,  &amp;  Jadad,  2011)  17  articles  that evaluated iCBT for chronic pain were evaluated. The total sample analyzed consisted of 2503 individuals with different chronic pain syndromes. Results showed that iCBT was associated with improvements in pain, activity limitation, and costs associated with treatment. The effects on depression and anxiety were less consistent. A meta-analysis aimed at evaluating the efficacy of different types of internet-based cognitive behavioral (iCBT) therapies in FM demonstrated that ICBTs provide a clinically relevant effect over control interventions in reducing negative mood and disability at the end of treatment (Bernardy, Klose, Welsch &amp; Häuser, 2019).

Preliminary  evidence  suggests  that  Web-based  MBIs  may  be  helpful  in  alleviating  the symptom burden that those with physical health conditions can experience, particularly when these interventions are tailored for specific symptoms (Toivonen, Zernicke &amp; Carlson, 2017). Furthermore,  a  literature  review  on  mindfulness-based  online  therapy  for  FM  patients highlighted two studies conducted on the subject. Both studies indicate a therapeutic potential for this method (Davis &amp; Zatura, 2013; Garrido-Torres et al., 2016).

It is important to note that these studies examined therapeutic intervention through recorded modules  and  not a direct therapeutic approach. Videoconference-delivered therapy is bidirectional such that it allows patients and their therapists to hear and see each other in real time, which may help to provide a greater sense of connection between the therapist and the patient  (Stamm, 1998;  Stefan  et  al.,  2021).  To  our  knowledge,  only  a  few  studies  examined cognitive -behavioral group protocol for chronic pain patients by videoconferencing (Connolly et  al.,  2018;  Palyo,  Schopmeyer,  &amp;  McQuaid, 2012;  Taguchi  et  al.,  2021)  and  mindfulness

videoconferencing for chronic pain patients (Gardner-Nix, Barbati, Grummitt, Pukal, &amp; Raponi Newton, 2014; Gardner-Nix, Backman, Barbati, &amp; Grummitt, 2018). These studies showed that videoconferencing is an effective mode of delivery for CBT and Mindfulness interventions for chronic  pain  and  may  represent  a  new  way  of  helping  chronic  pain  patients  manage  their suffering.  To  our  knowledge  no  study  examined  the  effectiveness  of  CBT  or  mindfulness videoconferencing therapies for FM patients.  For this reason, in addition to the general absence of sufficient studies and therapeutic tools examined in them, it is important to examine online CBT and mindfulness interventions for this population.

## 7. Adapting Generic Treatment Protocols for FM Patients

Recent years have seen a surge in research supporting personalized treatment, tailored to specific  disorders  (Barlow,  Allen,  &amp;  Choate,  2020).  Numerous  studies  have  pointed  to  the problems with using the same generic protocol for different conditions (i.e., a ' onesize fits all' approach;  Purgato,  Singh,  Acarturk,  &amp;  Cuijpers,  2021).  Following  this,  many  studies  were carried out on disorder-adapted treatments in the cognitive-behavioral approach (Goldin et al., 2014;Lahad &amp; Doron, 2010; Weeks et al., 2020) and in mindfulness-based treatments (Cairncross &amp; Miller, 2020; Schroevers et al., 2015;Taub et al., 2021). Nonetheless, most research on CBT and mindfulness-based interventions among FM patients has used a generic treatment protocol (Lauche et al., 2013). This is understandable, considering the vast research that indicates the effectiveness  of  these  protocols  for  a  wide  variety  of  populations  (Hofmann  et  al.,  2012; Praissman, 2008).

Our  study  examined  specific  adjustments  to  the  basic  protocols  of  CBT  and  MBSR  in accordance with the specific needs and characteristics of FM. Thus, we carefully adapted the standard protocols to address the symptoms of this condition more appropriately (e.g., emphasis on  chronic  pain,  sleep,  female  gender-related  characteristics,  physical  appearance,  and movement), as well as patients' abilities (e.g.,  shorter exercises,  more  gradual  processes). A detailed  explanation  of  each  of  the  protocols  can  be  found  in  the  method  section,  and  the protocols of the interventions are attached as an appendix (see appendix 1 and 2). We hope this

study will help to establish adequate protocols for treating FM -protocols which are currently sorely missing in this field.

## 8. Mechanisms of Change in FM Psychotherapy

After decades of psychotherapy research, there is no evidence-based explanation of how or why the most well-studied interventions produce change, that is, the mechanisms through which treatments operate (Kazdin, 2009). There are several reasons why it is important to discover mechanisms of change: First, finding a link between a mechanism and an improvement in the outcome measures will strengthen the understanding of the treatment's effectiveness. Second, this  endeavor  will  indicate  which  mechanisms  are  the  most  significant,  thus  improving  the effectiveness of treatment by highlighting to therapists what are the most important treatment targets.  And,  finally,  information  about  significant  mechanisms  and  their  relationship  with specific  symptoms  will  expand  our  understanding  regarding  both  mental  and  biological processes associated with a disorder (Jensen, Turner, &amp; Romano, 2007).

In this context it is necessary to mention "The Dodo bird verdict", a term first introduced by Luborsky, Singer and Luborsky (1975) . The  term  refers  to  the  issue  of  change  factors  in psychotherapy and, specifically, to different treatment approaches that bring the same results. For  this  reason,  researchers  tried  to  identify  shared  and  different  mechanisms  for  different treatments. Many times, scholars have concluded that there are generic mechanisms present in all types of treatment (Laska, Gurman, &amp; Wampold, 2014; Wampold, 2010). An important paper in this field (Norcross, 1995) claims that beyond these common factors, it is important to identify the specific mechanisms through which each treatment works. This notion is based on the facts that  not  all  types  of  psychological  treatment  have  been  tested,  that  a  reduction  in  the  same symptoms does not reflect the same long-term process and/or result, and that the appearance of identical  components  cannot  indicate  that  the  entire  treatment  process  is  the  same.  Various studies have examined the importance of cognitive processes for improvement in main outcome measures (depression, stress, anxiety, physical pain) following both CBT and MBSR (Alsubaie et al., 2017; Burns et al., 2023; Burns, Day &amp; Thorn, 2012; Burns, Van Dyke, Newman, Morais, &amp; Thorn, 2020; Teachma, Beadel, &amp; Steinman, 2014).

In conclusion, up to date, there are not enough studies on the mechanisms of psychological treatments for FM patients, and specifically, there are no studies that compare the mechanisms of  two  different  treatment  approaches.  In  this  study,  we  will  try  to  bridge  these  gaps,  by examining different mechanisms in CBT and MBSR for FM patients.

The next section will address potential mechanisms of change that will be examined in the present  study,  including  two  pain  cognition  (psychological  inflexibility  in  pain  and  pain catastrophizing) and one general mechanism- difficulties in emotion regulation. We chose these mechanisms because we believe that the connection to pain is critical in FM and as will be detailed  later,  these  mechanisms  were  also  found  to  be  significant  in  the  development  and maintenance of the disease. Along with this, we chose the emotional regulation mechanism that is  found  to  be  at  the  basis  of  the  development  of  various  psychopathologies  and  includes reference to different and more general cognitive and emotional components.

## 8.1 Psychological Inflexibility in Pain as a Mechanism of Change

Psychological flexibility is defined as the ability to behave adaptively in response to life events while accepting unpleasant thoughts, feelings, or physical symptoms. In our study, two mechanisms that make up psychological flexibility will be examined: avoidance and cognitive fusion  (Hayes  et  al.,  2006).  In  this  context,  cognitive  'fusion'  describes  the  ability  to  treat thoughts  as  'thoughts'  rather  than  as  necessary facts  that  one  is  bound  to  act  upon.    High cognitive fusion will describe focusing our attention on the contents of our mind (our thoughts, memories, assumptions, beliefs) rather than what we are experiencing. Psychological flexibility, specifically pain acceptance, has been shown to be related to psychological and physiological functioning among chronic pain patients (McCracken &amp; Morley, 2014).

Despite the research evidence for the importance of these processes in pain disorders, there is little evidence presenting that these processes are involved in the development of FM. Relevant research shows that cognitive fusion, avoidance, and acceptance in relation to pain are related to functional abilities among FM patients (Trainor, Baranoff, Henke, &amp; Winefield, 2018). Moreover, studies showed that an improvement in these processes may contribute to patients' sense  of  self-efficacy  (Trainor,  Baranoff,  Henke,  &amp;  Winefield,  2018)  and  that  psychological

flexibility may modulate the relation between the severity and impact of FM symptoms (Vallejo et al., 2021).

Regarding CBT, although it does not focus directly on the development of psychological flexibility, it seems that the two are connected in different aspects. The importance that CBT assigns to the separation between emotion and behavior and to the reduction of avoidance hints at  its  possible  contribution  to  the  development  of this  ability  (Espejo,  Gorlick,  &amp;  Castriotta, 2017; Yasinski et al., 2020). Currently, there is no sufficient research on this aspect of CBT in FM.  However,  there  is  significant  evidence  that  CBT  contributes  to  the  development  of psychological  flexibility  among  people  diagnosed  with  panic  disorder  and  social  anxiety (Gloster,  Klotsche,  Chaker,  Hummel,  &amp;  Hoyer,  2011).  Akerblom  and  colleagues  (2021) demonstrated that pre-treatment scores on the psychological inflexibility scale predicted CBT outcomes  (pain,  depression)  in  chronic  pain  patients  and  that  change  scores  on  each  of  the psychological flexibility measures separately mediated outcomes.

Within the third wave theories of CBT,  a willingness to maintain contact with negative experiences (such as fear and pain), as well as the ability to observe thoughts and feelings and not  react  to  them,  are  seen  as  important  factors  in  preventing  emotional  difficulties  and reduction in subjective well-being (Hayes et al., 2006; Kabat-Zinn, 1994). In addition, avoiding unpleasant experiences is seen as having the potential to alleviate symptoms in the short term, but leading to inflexibility and a narrowing of the potential range of emotional experiences in the long term, thereby harming daily functioning and mental well-being. Avoidance of pain is an  example  of  a  process  in  which  the  thought  or  fear  of  the  formation  of  pain  leads  to dysfunction.  Thus,  the  avoidance  resulting  from  thought  leads  to  maladaptive  behavior  in response to life events that have the potential to cause development and growth (Hayes et al., 2006). Only two studies examined the role of psychological inflexibility in pain as a potential mechanism  of  change  in  treatments  based  on  third  wave  theories.  The  first  conducted  an Acceptance and Commitment Therapy treatment (ACT) on chronic pain patients and found that psychological  inflexibility  in  pain  mediates  the  relationship  between  therapy  and  pain interference (Lin, Klatt, McCracken, &amp; Baumeister, 2018). A recent study conducted by PérezAranda et al. (2019) examined explored mindfulness and psychological inflexibility in pain as mechanisms of change in MBSR among FM patients. The results indicated that the changes

produced by MBSR on the impact of the disease were mediated by psychological inflexibility in pain and the mindfulness facet of 'acting with awareness". However, it is still limited since FM Impact is only one of the three subscales of the FM measure (FM Impact Questionnaire Revised; FIQR).

## 8.2 Pain Catastrophizing as a Mechanism of Change

The term catastrophizing was formally introduced by Albert Ellis (1962) and subsequently adapted by Aaron Beck (1979) to describe a maladaptive cognitive style employed by patients with anxiety and depressive disorders. At the core of their definitions, 'catastrophizing' was deemed the concept of an irrationally negative forecast of future events. Similarly, pain-related catastrophizing is broadly conceived as a set of exaggerated and negative cognitive and emotional schema brought to bear during actual or anticipated painful stimulation. It is defined as "a cognitive and emotional state where patients magnify the threat value of a pain stimulus in the context of pain and are unable to inhibit intrusive pain-related thoughts" (Sullivan &amp; Bishop, 1995).

Pain catastrophizing has been studied as a potential treatment mechanism among general chronic pain conditions (Burns, Johnson, Mahoney, Devine, &amp; Pawl, 1998; Jensen, Turner, &amp; Romano, 2001;Turner, Holtzman, &amp; Mancl, 2007) such as lower back pain (Spinhoven et al., 2004) and chronic headaches (Thorn et al., 2007).

Among FM patients, the maladaptive coping strategy of pain catastrophizing is believed to play a key role (Baastrup et al., 2016; Gracely et al., 2004), and was found to be positively associated with pain intensity (Paschali, Lazaridou, Paschalis, Napadow, &amp; Edwards, 2021). An important  review  describes  the  growing  body  of  literature  that  links  catastrophizing  and depression  to  the  experience  of  pain  across  several  rheumatic  diseases  (Edwards,  Cahalan, Mensing,  Smith,  &amp;  Haythornthwaite,  2011).  It describes the way  that depression  and catastrophizing are consistently correlated with each other, and how they are both associated with reported severity of pain, sensitivity to pain, physical disability, poor treatment outcomes, inflammatory disease activity, and even potentially early mortality (Edwards et al., 2011).

Relate  to  CBT,  the  evidence  that  a  change  in  pain  catastrophizing  represents  a therapeutic mechanism in CBT for chronic pain comes mostly from longitudinal designs using

correlation methods (Burns, Day &amp; Thorn, 2012). Few studies showed that reductions in pain catastrophizing were significantly related to outcome improvements of CBT for chronic pain (Burns,  Day,  &amp;  Thorn,  2012;  Gilliam  et  al.,  2021).  One  study  examined  the  role  of  pain catastrophizing  in  CBT for  FM  patients  and  showed  that  reductions  in  pain  catastrophizing mediated pain improvement (Lee et al., 2023).

To  the  best  of  our  knowledge,  no  study  examined  pain  catastrophizing  as  a  change mechanism in MBSR treatment for chronic pain patients (Adler-Neal, Zeidan, 2017). Despite the role that pain catastrophizing plays in pain-related conditions, it has been examined only once in  a  study  of  the  effect  of  MBSR  on  FM  patients  (Pérez-Aranda  et  al.,  2019)  but  only  as  an outcome  and  not  as  a  mechanism  of  change.  Nevertheless,  there  are  studies  that  showed  a connection between mindfulness therapy and catastrophizing (Kearson et al., 2019; Turner et al., 2016).

## 8.3 Emotion regulation as a Mechanism of Change

Different  researchers  attribute  different  abilities  and  processes  to  the  concept  of emotional regulation. From the overview of the various models, emotional regulation can be characterized  as  a  concept  that  involves  emotional  diversity  and  flexibility,  awareness  and understanding of emotions, acceptance of emotion, the ability to control impulsive behaviors in response to negative emotions, and the ability to use emotional regulation strategies in a flexible manner that matches the emotional state and the functional goal (Gratz &amp; Roemer, 2004).

In  accordance  with  the  cognitive  behavioral  theories  of  psychopathology,  which emphasize the importance of the cognitive and emotional mechanisms that underlie the distress in  contrast  to  the  importance  of  the  symptoms  accompanying  it  (Hayes,  Wilson,  Gifford, Follette,  &amp;  Strosahl,  1996),  various  studies  have  begun  to  consider  the  role  of  emotional regulation  processes  as  having  the  potential  to  constitute  a  mechanism  that  leads  to  the development of various symptoms and inadaptability behaviors (Gross &amp; Munoz, 1995).

Despite the high emotional distress among FM patients, few studies have addressed the processes of emotional regulation among this population. Studies that referred to emotional regulation showed that the emotional world of FM patients is characterized by high emotional intensity.  Accordingly,  they  identified  a  high  level  of  negative  emotion  and  a  low  level  of

positive emotion in FM patients. Moreover, difficulty identifying and expressing emotions, as well as the use of emotional avoidance have been found in FM patients (Middendorp et al., 2008; Sayar, Gulec, &amp; Topbas, 2004). Another study shows that the ability to express emotions is linked to a decrease in the level of symptoms among FM patients (Geenen, Ooijen-van der Linden, Lumley, Bijlsma, &amp; Middendorp, 2012). Moreover, another study showed that FM patients did not diverge from the healthy group in the amount of attention or awareness allotted to their mood states. However, they did differ in the acceptance of mood states, the ability to concentrate or perform  tasks while experiencing negative mood  states, the experience  of  becoming overwhelmed by emotional intensity and its persistence, as well as in their understanding and clarity of the emotions they experience (Trucharte et al., 2020).

A  novel  proposed  model  of  FM  suggests  that an  imbalance  in  emotion  regulation, reflected  by  an  overactive  threat  system  and  underactive  soothing  system,  might  keep  the 'salience network' (also known as the midcingulo -insular network) in continuous alert mode and that this hyperactivation, in conjunction with other mechanisms, contributes to FM (Pinto et al., 2022).

Various  studies  have  referred  to  the  emotional  regulation  process  as  a  therapeutic mechanism among a variety of populations. In relation to CBT, studies comparing the presence of emotional processing in CBT with other therapeutic modalities have revealed conflicting findings. While some researchers have reported no difference in emotional processing outcome between psychodynamic therapy and CBT (Coombs, Coleman, &amp; Jones, 2002; Jones &amp; Pulos, 1993), others have reported that experiential and psychodynamic therapies facilitate emotional processing  more  effectively  than  CBT  (Rudkin,  Llewelyn,  Hardy,  Stiles,  &amp;  Barkham,  2007; Watson  &amp;  Bedard,  2006).  Along  with  this,  there  are  studies  suggesting  that  emphasizing emotional regulation strategies in cognitive-behavioral therapy promotes the effectiveness of the treatment (Berking et al., 2008). To summarize, the place of the emotional regulation process as a change mechanism in cognitive-behavioral therapy has not yet been clarified.

In  relation  to  the  'third  wave'  treatments  of  the  cognitive-behavioral  approach, mindfulness-based meditation has been found to promote processes of emotional regulation (Kabat-zinn, 1994;Kabat-Zinn, 1990;Teper, Segal, &amp; Inzlicht, 2013). In addition, studies show a relationship between high levels of mindfulness and the ability to regulate emotions (Gratz &amp;

Roemer,  2004;  Feldman,  Hayes,  Kumar,  Greeson,  &amp;  Laurenceau,  2007).  These  results  were maintained even when the effects of stress, anxiety and depression were neutralized. In contrast, the  research  of  Chamber,  Gullone,  &amp;  Allen  (2009)  refers  to  aspects  of  mindfulness-based treatment that may hinder the effective use of emotional regulation processes and points to the importance of research to develop an understanding of whether the treatment promotes these processes with an emphasis on understanding the interaction between the various components of mindfulness and emotional regulation. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study that examined emotional regulation as a mechanism  in  CBT and mindfulness-based therapy for patients diagnosed with chronic pain or FM.

In conclusion, there is a significant research gap in understanding the involvement of the emotional regulation processes in the treatment processes - both in CBT and in mindfulness and there is a need for more studies that examine the role of this emotional regulation within different treatment methods.

As can be seen, in general the mechanisms we will focus on - flexibility, catastrophizing and emotional regulation - were found to be important for FM and specifically were also found to be related to the effectiveness of both CBT and MBSR. However, they have been studied very little in these contexts, and their role in the treatment of FM in different approaches is not clear enough. Therefore, the current study will examine the role of these mechanisms in the two treatment methods, and will try to understand whether they play a role there, and if yes - whether they  have  a  differential  role  in  the  two  treatment  methods,  and  against  different  outcome measures (for example, stress, quality of life)

Figure 1 illustrates the suggested mechanisms, their components, and examples that reflect their different aspects.

## Research Questions and Hypotheses

In our study, we will examine a variety of outcome measures in FM therapy, covering FM symptoms, depression, perceived stress, and health related quality of life. We believe that these  measures  comprehensively  represent  the  expected  changes  following  our  proposed interventions,  and  most  importantly,  cover  both  physical  and  psychological  aspects  of  the disorder.  In  addition,  we  will  examine  three  potential  mechanisms  of  change  in  MBSR  and CBT: difficulties in emotion regulation, pain catastrophizing, and psychological inflexibility in pain.

The  current  study  presents  three  major  research  questions:  1.  Are  CBT  and  MBSR effective  for  treating  FM  patients,  and  if  so -are they  differentially  effective?  2. Is psychotherapy delivered by video conferencing effective for treating FM patients? 3.What are the mechanisms of change that are associated with CBT and MBSR for FM? Based on these questions, we will focus on the following research hypotheses:

hypothesis #1: FM patients receiving CBT or MBSR will show greater improvements in FM symptoms, depression, perceived stress and health-related quality of life between pre- to postintervention, compared to the waitlist (WL) control group.

hypothesis #2: All expected changes of CBT and MBSR between pre- and post-intervention will remain stable over a 4-month follow-up period. There will be a decrease between pre- and postintervention, then no change between post-intervention and the follow-up measurement.

hypothesis  #3:  FM  patients  receiving  CBT  or  MBSR  by  ZOOM  will  show  greater improvements in FM symptoms, depression, perceived stress, and health-related quality of life between  pre-  to  post-intervention,  compared  to  waitlist  (WL)  control  group  and  a  similar effectiveness to face to face CBT and MBSR.

hypothesis #4: All expected changes of CBT and MBSR by ZOOM between pre- and postintervention  will  remain  stable  over  a  4-month  follow-up  period.  There  will  be  a  decrease between pre- and post-intervention, then no change between post-intervention and the followup measurement.

hypothesis #5: Psychological inflexibility in pain will be used as a change mechanism in both MBSR and CBT. Thus, the degree  of  change  in  psychological  inflexibility  in  pain  will  be positively correlated with the degree of change in fibromyalgia, major depression and perceived stress, and in a negative correlation with a health-related quality of life.

hypothesis #6: Pain catastrophizing will be used as a change mechanism in both MBSR and CBT. Thus, the degree of change in Pain catastrophizing will be positively correlated with the degree of change in fibromyalgia, major depression and perceived stress, and in a negative correlation with a health-related quality of life.

hypothesis #7: Difficulties in emotion Regulation will be used as a change mechanism in both MBSR and CBT. Thus, the degree  of  change  in  difficulties  in  emotion  Regulation  will  be

positively correlated with the degree of change in fibromyalgia, major depression and perceived stress, and in a negative correlation with a health-related quality of life

Hypothesis  #8:  Although  we  hypothesize  that  flexibility,  catastrophizing,  and  emotional regulation  will  play  a  role  in  the  change  due  to  the  two  treatment  methods,  in  light  of  the essential  difference  in  the  two  methods,  and  in  light  of  preliminary  findings  from  the  little research that  exists in the field, we hypothesize that  differential effects will nevertheless be found for the two methods. Thus, we hypothesize in an exploratory way that the relationships between the mechanisms and the degree of change due to CBT and MBSR will not be the same, and there will be differences in the strength of the relationships and their actual existence in certain cases.

**Because the mechanisms of change include different subscales (eg, fusion, magnification), we hypothesize that different aspects of the mechanisms will play different roles as mechanisms of change in treatment. There is not enough literature to lead us to hypothesize in a directional manner about a certain sub-index, but we hypothesize that there will be different differential effects.

## Materials and Methods

## 1. Participants and Procedure

The participants in the study were fibromyalgia patients, insured by the 'Maccabi' health care  in  Israel.  Participants  were  recruited  from  two  major  sources:  1.  Advertisements  on 'Maccabi' health care , 2. advertisements posted on social media (online groups and forums of FM patients)  and  sent  to  organizations  supporting  FM  patients.  The  study  included  93  FM patients that were randomly assigned to either the CBT group (n=32), MBSR group (n=28), or the  WL  control  group  (n=33).  The  sample  ranged  in  age  from  20  to  74  years  (mean±SD: 47.53±12.69 years).

The criteria for study inclusion were: 1) a documented clinical diagnosis of FM given by an expert  rheumatologist  and/or  clinical  immunologist,  2)  age  18  years  or  older,  3)  Hebrew speakers, 4) physical ability to attend MBSR sessions, 5) no serious cognitive impairments, 6) no psychosis, 7) no active suicidality, 8) no substance abuse, 9) no concurrent participation in

another clinical study, 10) no concurrent participation in another mindfulness-based/cognitive behavioral group therapy, 11) insured by 'Maccabi' health care .

Our study was made under the supervision of the Ethics Committee of Maccabi Healthcare (ASMC-0111118). The screening process was comprised of several steps. First, an introductory phone call was conducted with all individuals who showed an interest in participation. The introductory conversation included a general explanation regarding group therapy and study participation, explanation of participation in online therapy for the relevant groups, as well as an initial screening. In this step we excluded those who were either not interested after hearing the details, not available (due to distance, busy schedule, etc.), not members of 'Maccabi' health care,  or  lacked  a  formal  FM  diagnosis  (individuals  in  the  process  of  being  diagnosed  were invited to call the study center upon completion of the process). Following the initial screening, we  conducted  clinical  interviews  that  collected  several  types  of  information:  1)  medical information, such as medical and pharmacological treatment, FM chronicity, and other known medical conditions, 2) cognitive functioning, including serious head injury and concentration capacity  including  potential  attention  deficit  hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD)  diagnoses. Cognitive  impairment  was  assessed  to  ensure  a  basic  capacity  to  exercise  mindfulness.  3) psychiatric and psychological information: individuals answered several questionnaires from the Paykel suicide scale (Paykel, Myers, Lindenthal, &amp; Tanner, 1974), the alcohol use disorders identification  test  (AUDIT)  (Babor,  Higgins-Biddle,  Saunders.,  Monteiro,  &amp;  World  Health Organization, 2001), and the Yale university PRIME screening test (Miller, 2004) for probable psychosis. Appendix 3 presents the clinical interview as described.

A detailed description of study procedures can be found in Figure 2 (PRISMA chart). All participants provided informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study.  After screening process, patients were randomly assigned to either an CBT group,  MBSR group or a wait-list control group. Patients assigned to the WL control group received no active treatment during their  waiting  period;  upon  completion  of  this  time,  they  received  CBT/MBSR.  Due  to  the outbreak of the corona virus and with the approval of the ethics committee, it was decided to move the treatment online by videoconferecing using the Zoom application. Therefore, as you can see, about half of the subjects in each treatment methods underwent remote online treatment.

To  ensure  that  there  were  no  significant  differences  between  groups  following randomization, all the variables in this study were  compared  at baseline.  Following randomization, paired-sample t-tests and chi-squared/Fisher tests were performed to compare the  MBSR  and  WL  groups  on  baseline  measures.  Table  1  presents  patient  demographic characteristics.  Appendix  4  presents  Comparison  of  Baseline  Demographic  and  Physical Characteristics between the face-to-face and ZOOM interventions.

NOTE: **p &lt; .01

As presented in Table 1, one way Anova and chi-square/Fisher tests for independence demonstrated that there were no significant differences between the CBT, MBSR and the WL groups on demographic measures, expect for Gender. In addition, there were no significant differences  between  the  groups  in  baseline  clinical  measures  FM  (FIQR)  [F(93)=0.35,  n.s], perceived stress [F(93)=2.30 n.s],  and major depression (PHQ) [F(93)=0.30 n.s], quality of life (HRQOL) [F(93)=0.05, n.s], except for quality of sleep (PSQI) [F(93)=10.37 p&lt;0.05].

## 2. Randomization and Measurement

Patients were randomized using the SPSS 23.0 statistical software package randomization algorithm. Patients in the WL were blinded from their allocation to the control group and were told they were waiting for the next group opening. Participants were given an anonymous code at the beginning of the study and were asked to use the code to conceal any personal details (i.e., names or ID) that could reveal their identity. The study coordinator was the only one who had access  to  the  code-name  matrix.  All  participants  signed  an  informed  consent  form  prior  to participation and were informed that they could withdraw from the study at any point. When switching to treatment through the Zoom application, the consent form was updated to refer to online treatment and questionnaires were sent to participants via email. Half of the patients were recruited after the outbreak of COVID-19 and were blinded allocated to 3 groups (CBT, MBSR and WL).

Data was collected at three time points: baseline (before the first treatment session), the end of the intervention (immediately after the final treatment session), and 4 months after treatment as a follow-up assessment. The follow-up assessment was only conducted for the MBSR/CBT groups. We employed an intention-to-treat (ITT) approach for our analysis, i.e., all randomized participants were contacted post-treatment to fill out questionnaires, regardless of whether they attended the entire therapy or had dropped out (Fisher et al., 1990). This was intended to provide a complete, reliable, and externally valid picture of our patients.

## 3. Treatment protocols

## 3.1 MBSR protocol

The MBSR protocol includes an adaptation of the classic MBSR treatment (Kabat-Zinn, 1990),  meant  to  specifically  suit  the  needs  of  fibromyalgia  patients.  The  protocol  was successfully implemented and validated in a previous study from our group (Taub et al., 2021). The weekly sessions include different mental and physical mindfulness exercises (e.g., bodyscan, f ocusing one's attention on breathing ,  being fully aware during everyday activities), as well as information sessions and discussions on stress, stress management, and how to apply mindfulness to interpersonal communication. The changes made to the protocol included the extension  of  the  basic  protocol  to  10  weeks  (instead  of  8),  in  order  to  include  an  in-depth

psychoeducation phase, as well as to allow more gradual practice. In addition, the duration of the meetings was shortened to an hour and a half so that there is no overload on the patients.

Also, exercises were adapted to focus on typical difficulties of fibromyalgia patients, including chronic  pain  and  fatigue.  The  groups  were  led  by  qualified  and  experienced  mindfulness teachers. Each meeting began with a joint discussion by group members about the homework they completed during the week and in some meetings there were discussions and exercises conducted in pairs, that were followed by group conversations. In addition, in the middle part of  the  treatment  there  was  a  long  practice  day  where  the  group  spent  several  straight  hours practicing.

## 3.2 CBT protocol

This  treatment  was  constructed  based  on  various  protocols  of  cognitive-behavioral treatment for chronic pain patients (Bernardy et al., 2010; Glombiewski et al., 2010; Thorn &amp; Kuhajda 2006; Vallejo et al., 2015). The treatment was conducted over 10 weeks, with weekly meetings  lasting  an  hour  and  a  half  each.  The  protocol  includes  three  main  parts:  first, psychoeducation (the ' thoughts-feelings-beahvior ' cycle, as well as information on pain and stress).  Second,  identifying  and  monitoring  negative  and  maladaptive  thought  patterns  (e.g., cognitive  reconstruction,  work  on  maladaptive  thinking  schemes),  and  third,  behavioral interventions  (e.g.,  exposure  to  situations  posing  functioning  challenges,  active  planning, response prevention). Moreover, emotion regulation techniques were learned in most of the sessions. Specific issues, such as sleep difficulties, were also allocated specific time in sessions. Between the meetings assignments were given as homework and a review was conducted at the next meeting. The treatment was guided by a qualified and experienced CBT therapist, who is a licensed clinical psychologist. Similar to the mindfulness protocol, we have added couple and group practices, and each session began with a joint conversation about homework. In addition, we have added exercises during which a member of the group presents daily difficulties and thus enables group feedback.

## Measures

Demographic  background:  Prior  to  the  intervention  (or  waiting  period  for  the  WL  group), participants were asked about their age, gender, ethnic background, income, family status, daily

habits, and employment situation. Moreover, we asked questions regarding the chronicity of the disorder, the date of its diagnosis, medication use, medical follow-up and compliance with it, psychiatric treatment, and pregnancy history.

The FM Impact Questionnaire Revised (FIQR; Bennett et al., 2009): The FIQR is a 21-item selfreport instrument developed by Bennett et al. (2009) in order to assess primary FM symptoms, physical  function  deficits,  and  quality  of  life.  This  is  an  updated  version  of  the  FIQ,  an extensively validated measure with comparable scoring. In addition to a total score, the FIQR also assesses scores of three individual subscales: Function, Impact, and Symptoms. Higher scores indicate a more negative impact of FM symptoms. In this study, the FIQR demonstrated very good internal consistency with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.93.

The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9; Kroenke, Spitzer, &amp; Williams, 2001): This measure is a self-administered questionnaire used to assess Major Depressive Disorder symptoms, which scores each of the 9 DSMIV criteria on a scale of 0 ('not at all') to 3 ('nearly every day'). It can yield  either  a  continuous  score  or  a  probable  Major  Depressive  Disorder  diagnosis.  Recent validation  studies  have  suggested  that  the  accuracy  of  the  measures  in  predicting  Major Depressive Disorder could be improved by using a rather conservative cut-off  scores between 8 and 11 (Manea, Gilbody, &amp; McMillan, 2012). Based on these studies, we used a cut-off score of 10 for a Major Depressive Disorder probable diagnosis. Thus, 0-9- indicates no depressive symptoms or mild depressive symptoms, 10 -14 indicates moderate depressive symptoms, and 15 -27 indicates moderately-severe depressive symptoms ; (Kroenke, Spitzer, &amp; Williams, 2001). In the current study, PHQ-9 demonstrated very good internal consistency with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.84.

The Perceived Stress Scale  (PSS; Cohen, &amp; Williamson 1988): This measure is a widely used and well-validated 10item scale that measures the degree to which situations in one's life over the previous month are considered unpredictable, uncontrollable, and overwhelming. It posits that people appraise potentially threatening or challenging events in relation to their available coping resources. Items are rated on a Likert scale ranging from 0 ('never') to 4 ('very often'). A higher score indicates a greater degree of perceived stress. The PSS is often found to possess

very good psychometric properties. In this study, the PSS showed very good reliability with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.88.

The  World  Health  Organization  Quality  of  Life  Questionnaire-Brief  Version  (WHOQOLBRIEF: The Whoqol Group, 1998):This measure was developed based on the original 100-item WHQOL questionnaire. It is a 26-item scale with each item rated on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely). It comprises five subscales that represent several quality of life domains: general, physical,  psychological,  social,  and  environmental  quality  of  life.  In  the  present  study, WHOQOL-BRIEF had a Cronbach's alpha of 0.7 9.

Psychological Inflexibility in Pain Scale (PIPS;Wicksell, Lekander, Sorjonen, &amp; Olsson, 2010): This is a 12-item measure based on a Likert scale of 1 (never true) to 7 (always true) per item, developed to assess psychological inflexibility towards pain (i.e., one's ability or inability to manage pain in a flexible manner while not avoiding it altogether or being inundated by it). The PIPS includes 2 subscales: Pain Avoidance and Cognitive Fusion. The total score ranges from 12 -84. PIPS showed very good reli ability in the present study with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.90.

Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS; Sullivan, Bishop, &amp; Pivik, 1995): This measure consists of 13 items evaluating different thoughts and feelings that individuals may experience when they are in pain. The PCS instructions ask participants to reflect on their past painful experiences and to indicate on a 5-point scale the degree to which they experienced each of 13 thoughts and feelings when experiencing pain (0= ' not at all ' and 4= ' all the time ' ). The PCS yields one total score and three subscale scores assessing rumination (eg, 'I can't stop thinking about how much it hurts'), magnification (eg, 'I worry that something serious may happen'), and helplessness (eg, 'There is  nothing  I  can  do  to  reduce  the  intensity  of  the  pain') .  PCS  showed  very  good  internal consistency in the current study at 0.91 in Study.

Difficulties  in  Emotion  Regulation  Scale  (DERS;  Gratz  &amp;  Roemer,  2004)  is  a  self-report questionnaire  assessing  emotion  regulation  difficulties.  It  comprises  36  items  assessing  six domains: non -acceptance of negative emotions, inability to engage in goal-directed behaviors, difficulties  controlling  impulsive  behaviors,  limited  access  to  effective  emotion  regulation strategies, lack of emotional awareness, and lack of emotional clarity. Responses are given on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 (almost never) to 5 (almost always). The questionnaire was found to

have  good  psychometric  properties  (Gratz  &amp;  Roemer,  2004) Error!  Reference  source  not found. .  In  the  current study, the DERS demonstrated very good internal consistency, with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.87.

Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI; Buysse et al.,1989) measures self-reported sleep quality and disturbances during the previous 4 weeks. It has 19 items and measures 7 components of sleep:  sleep  quality,  sleep  latency,  sleep  duration,  sleep  disturbances,  use  of  sleeping medication, habitual sleep efficiency, and daytime dysfunction. The component scores have each a range of 0 -3 points and are added to yield one global PSQI score (range of 0 -21 points) which distinguishes good sleep (PSQI total score &lt;5) from poor sleep (PSQI total score &gt;5). The questionnaire  was  found  to  have  good  psychometric  properties  (Buysse  et  al.,1989).  This measure was tested only in the background data but not as an outcome measure.

## Results

## 1. Pre- to Post-treatment Differences Between the CBT, MBSR and WL groups

In order to examine changes in outcome measures among CBT and MBSR participants in comparison  to  WL  controls,  we  conducted  a  repeated  measures  Multivariate  Analysis  of Variance (MANOVA)  and Univariate analyses (ANOVA) for Group X Time interactions. The variables intervention type (face-to-face or zoom), gender, and sleep quality were considered as covariates  due  to  initial  differences  found  between  the  groups.  The  analysis  was  conducted using  Group  (MBSR, CBT, WL) as a between-subject independent variable and Time (preintervention compared to post-intervention) as a within-subjects independent variable. A series of  dependent  variables  were  examined:  FM,  health-related  quality  of  life,  depression  and perceived stress. Additionally, we conducted MANOVA to examine changes in the subscales of FM and health-related quality of life. A subsequent Univariate analysis was conducted for all for the measures that were comprised of subscales even if the MANOVA was not significant. We  chose  to  conduct  these  tests  due  to  the  small  number  of  subjects  and  the  amount  of comparisons made. To establish the source of the interaction, every MANOVA and ANOVA followed by subsequent pairwise comparisons. Table 2 presents the Multivariate and Univariate

effects and descriptive statistics for Group X Time comparisons. For the tests that came out significant, we performed effect size calculations.

As presented in Table 2, the Univariate analysis for FM total score showed a significant effect for  Group  X  Time  interaction  with  a  medium  effect  size,  a  non-significant  effect  for  Time [F(1,69)=0.2,  n.s],  and  a  non-significant  effect  for  Group  [F(1,69)=0.6,  n.s].  A  pairwise comparison  revealed  a  significant  improvement  in  the  MBSR  group  (i-j=10.21,  SE=2.41, p&lt;0.01, Cohen's  d= 1.71),  compared  to  non-significant  change  in  the  CBT  group  (i-j=2.97, SE=2.24, n.s) and the WL group (i-j=1.22, SE=2.32, n.s).

When all subscales of FM were tested together, FM yielded non-significant interaction of Group X Time [F(6,134)=1.65, n.s], and non-significant effect for Time [F(3,67)=0.72, n.s], or Group [F(6,134)=1. 54 ,   n.s] . In  relation  to  the  different  FM  subscales  (FIQR),  we  found  a  significant effect  for  impact  subscale  for  Group  X  Time  interaction  with  a  medium  effect  size,  nonsignificant effect for Time  [F(1,69)=0.66, n.s], and  a non-significant effect  for  Group [F(2,69)=0.38, n.s].  A pairwise comparison revealed a significant improvement in the MBSR group    for  Impact  (i-j=4.03,  SE=1.14,    p&lt;0.01, Cohen's  d= 1.35)  and  Symptoms  (i-j=4.40, SE=1.26, p&lt;0.01, Cohen's d= 0.94) subscales, and a significant improvement in the CBT group for  symptoms  (i-j=3.14,  SE=1.17,  p&lt;0.01, Cohen's  d= 1.72)  subscale,    compared  to  nonsignificant change in the WL group in all subscales.

A  Univariate  analysis  for  health-related  quality  of  life  total  score  (HRQOL)  showed  nonsignificant  effect  for  Group  X  Time  interaction  [F(2,66)=1.98,  n.s],  non-significant  effect  for Time [F(1,66)=0.13, n.s], and a non-significant effect for Group [F(2,66)=1.18, n.s]. A pairwise comparison revealed a significant improvement in the MBSR group (i-j=-1.62, SE=0.60,  p&lt;0.01, Cohen's d= -1.16), compared to non-significant change in the CBT group (i-j=-1.02, SE=0.56, n.s) and the WL group (i-j=0.05, SE=0.57, n.s). A Multivariate Analysis for health-related quality of life (HRQOL)  subscales showed a non-significant interaction of Group X Time [F(8, 122 )=1.27, n.s], and non-significant effect for Time  [F(4,61)=0.30, n.s], or  Group [F( 8 , 122 )= 0 . 51 ,   n.s] . In  relation  to  the  different  HRQOL subscales, significant effect only for physical health subscale for Group X Time with a medium effect size, non-significant effect for Time [F(1,64)=0.00, n.s], and for Group [F(2,64)=0.18, n.s]. A pairwise comparison revealed a significant improvement in the Physical health subscale for MBSR group (i-j=-3.29, SE=0.50,

p&lt;0.01, Cohen's d= -2.08), CBT group (i-j=-1.81, SE=0.47,  p&lt;0.01, Cohen's d= 1.81), and WL group (i-j=-1.10, SE=0.47,  p&lt;0.05 , Cohen's d=0.90 ).

A Univariate analysis for major depression (PHQ-9) showed non-significant effect for Group X Time interaction,    a  significant  effect  for  Time  [F(1,68)=4.78,  p&lt;0.05],  and  a  non-significant effect for Group [F(2,68)=1.99, n.s]. A pairwise comparison revealed a significant improvement in the MBSR group (i-j=2.81, SE=1.08,  p&lt;0.01, Cohen's d= 0.97), compared to non-significant change in the CBT group (i-j=1.76, SE=1.02, n.s) and the WL group (i-j=1.19, SE=1.04, n.s).

Figure 3 presents the change in the diagnosis levels of Major depression between the beginning and end of the MBSR treatment.

As you can see, some of the patients who suffered from depression at a severe level improved and therefore at the end of the treatment their distress corresponded to the diagnosis of moderate major depression. T1

A Univariate analysis for perceived stress (PSS) showed non-significant  effect for Group X Time interaction,  non-significant effect for Time [F(1,69)=3.56, n.s], and a non-significant effect for Group [F(2,69)=1.86, n.s]. A pairwise comparison revealed a significant improvement in the MBSR group (i-j=3.23, SE=1.47,  p&lt;0.05, Cohen's d= 0.68), compared to non-significant change in the CBT group (i-j=2.01, SE=1.47, n.s) and the WL group (i-j=1.20, SE=1.41, n.s).

To  assess  the  long-term  effects  of  CBT  and  MBSR,  we  conducted  Multivariate  and

Univariate analyses, which included the follow-up assessment 4 months after the last session. We based this analysis on the CBT and MBSR groups alone, as the WL group did not go through a follow-up assessment. The second step of the analysis included contrasts between the effect of pre-treatment to post- treatment versus post- treatment to follow-up in order to detect the source of the effect.  When performing these tests, we noticed that effects found to be significant between the first and second time point (pre and post treatment) appear in the joint comparison as non-significant. This change occurred because in a repeated measurements type test, the test is  performed  only  on  the  subjects  who  filled  out  the  three  questionnaires,  a  limitation  that reduces the number of subjects. Following this discovery, we separated the tests so that the results of the follow-up tests refer to a comparison of the post treatment point to the follow-up point alone, to test for stability over time (i.e., to see whether there was no change between the 2 nd and  3 rd   assessment).  Thus,  the  subjects  included  in  the  test  are  those  who  filled  out  the questionnaires at the time point at the end of the treatment and at the follow-up measurement. In addition, we will present graphs that show the three points together so that the change trend along the measurement points can be seen. The follow-up tests were performed only for the variables that were found to be significant in comparisons of pre and post treatment.

## 2.1 Long-Term Effectiveness of MBSR

To  assess  the  long-term  effects  of  MBSR,  we  conducted  Multivariate  analysis  and Univariate  analyses  to  compare  post  treatment  to  follow-up  measure,  with  the  follow-up assessment 4 months after the last session.

Figure 5 present the significant effects of pre- to post-intervention measurements and the nonsignificant of post- intervention to follow-up for the MBSR on several outcome measures.

As you can see, the Multivariate and Univariate Analysis for post treatment to follow-up in FM, FM  impact  and  symptoms  subscales,  health-related  quality  of  life,  major  depression,  and perceived  stress  were  non-significant  [respectively  (( 1 ,16)=0.29,  n.s  ),  (F( 1 ,16)=0.10,  n.s),( F( 1 ,16)=0.26, n.s), (F( 1 ,15)=0.06, n.s), (F( 1 ,16)=1.67, n.s), (F( 1 ,16)=1.12, n.s)]. In conclusion, the only significant improvement following the MBSR that was not maintained in the follow up measurement is the change in physical subscale of health-related quality of life.

## 2.2 Long-Term Effectiveness of CBT

To assess the long-term effects of CBT, we conducted Multivariate Analysis to compare posttreatment to follow-up measure, with the follow-up assessment 4 months after the last session. Figure 6 present the significant effects of pre- to post-intervention measurements and the nonsignificant of post- intervention to follow-up for the CBT on several outcome measures.

Note: Pre-intervention (1); post-intervention (2); follow-up (3). (a) Fibromyalgia symptoms time effect in CBT (b) Quality of life physical subscale time effect in CBT.

As you can see, the Multivariate Analysis for post treatment to follow-up in CBT group, the FM symptoms subscale and health-related quality of life physical subscale were  non-significant [respectively (F( 1 ,13)=0.01, n.s), (F( 1 ,13)=0.55, n.s)].

## 3. Pre to Post-treatment Differences Between face-to-face and online therapy

In order to compare face-to-face treatment and treatment delivered by video conference (Zoom) in  both  treatment  approaches,  we  conducted  a  repeated  measures  Multivariate  Analysis  of Variance (MANOVA) and Univariate Analysis (ANOVA) for Group X Time interactions. The analysis was conducted using Group (CBT, CBT ZOOM, WL and MBSR, MBSR ZOOM, WL) as  a  between-subject  independent  variable  and  Time  (pre-intervention  compared  to  postintervention) as a within-subjects independent variable. A series of dependent variables were examined: FM, depression, perceived stress, and health-related quality of life. Additionally, we conducted MANOVA to examine changes in the subscales of FM and health-related quality of life.  A  subsequent  Univariate  analysis  was  conducted  for  all  for  the  measures  that  were comprised of subscales even if the MANOVA was not significant. We chose to conduct these tests due to the small number of subjects and the number of comparisons made. To establish the source  of  the  interaction,  every  MANOVA  and  ANOVA  followed  by  subsequent  pairwise comparisons.

As can be seen in Table 3, a Univariate analysis for FM (FIQR) showed a significant effect for Group X Time interaction with a large effect size, but not for Time [F(1,49)=0.25, n.s] nor for Group [F(2,49) =0.10, n.s]. A pairwise comparison of the MBSR, MBSR ZOOM groups versus the WL group in revealed a significant improvement in the MBSR ZOOM group (i-j=13.77, SE=3.4,  p&lt;0.01, Cohen's  d= 2.28),  a  significant  improvement  in  the  MBSR  group  (i-j=7.04, SE=3.4, p&lt;0.05, Cohen's d= 1.27), compared to non-significant change in the WL group (i-j=0.22, SE=2.28, n.s).

Next , we  conducted  Multivariate  analysis  for  the  FM  subscales  (i.e.  Function,  Impact,  and Symptoms). This test showed a non-significant interaction of Group X Time [F(6,94)=1.80, n.s], non-significant effect for Time [F( 3 , 47 )=0. 91 ,  n.s], or Group [F(6,94)=1.65, n.s] . In relation to the different FM subscales, Function and Symptom subscales yielded a significant interaction of Group X Time with medium effect size.  A  pairwise  comparison  of  the  MBSR  and  MBSR ZOOM groups versus the WL group in revealed a significant improvement in the MBSR group only  for  the  impact  subscale  (i-j=3.74,  SE=1.62,  p&lt;0.05, Cohen's  d= 1.32),  and  a  significant improvement with large effect sizes in the MBSR ZOOM group for all subscales Function (ij=3.37, SE=1.31, p&lt;0.05, Cohen's d= 2.07), Impact (i-j=4.46, SE=1.62, p&lt;0.01, Cohen's d= 1.40) and Symptoms  (i-j=5.57, SE=1.54, p&lt;0.01, Cohen's d= 2.43), and non a significant improvement in the WL group.

A Univariate analysis for health-related quality of life (HRQOL) showed a significant effect for Group X Time interaction with large effect size, but not for Time [F(1,48)=0.31, n.s] nor for Group [F(2,48) =1.84, n.s]. A pairwise comparison revealed a significant improvement in the MBSR  ZOOM  group (i-j=-2.93,  SE=0.73,  p&lt;0.01, Cohen's  d= -1.97),  compared  to  nonsignificant change in the MBSR group (i-j=-0.54, SE=0.77, n.s), and in the WL group (i-j=-0.16, SE=0.49, n.s).

Next , we  conducted  Multivariate  analysis  for  the  quality  of  life  subscales  (i.e.  physical, psychological,  social,  and  environmental).  This  test  showed  a  non-significant  interaction  of Group X Time [F(8,86)=1.23, n.s], non-significant effect for Time [F(4, 43 )=0.43, n.s], or Group [F(8,86)=0.30,  n.s] . In  relation  to  the  different  HRQOL  subscales,  we  found  non-significant interactions. A pairwise comparison of the MBSR, MBSR ZOOM groups versus the WL group in    Physical  subscale  revealed  a  significant  improvement  in  the  MBSR  group  (i-j=-2.79, SE=0.80, p&lt;0.01, Cohen's d= -1.81), MBSR ZOOM group (i-j=-3.00, SE=0.78, p&lt;0.01, Cohen's d=-2.04) and the WL group (i-j=-1.10, SE=0.51, p&lt;0.05). A pairwise comparison of the MBSR, MBSR ZOOM groups versus the WL group in  Environment subscale revealed a significant improvement  in  the  MBSR  ZOOM  group  (i-j=-1.36,  SE=0.57,  p&lt;0.05, Cohen's  d= -1.71), compared to non-significant change in the MBSR group (i-j=0.31, SE=0.58, n.s) and the WL group (i-j=-0.38, SE=0.37, n.s). We did not find significant change in any of the other scales (psychological, social).

A  Univariate  analysis  for  major  depression  (PHQ-9)  showed  a  significant  effect  for  Time [F(1,49)=4.26, P&lt;0.05], but not for Group X Time interaction, or Group [F(2,49) =0.04, n.s]. A pairwise  comparison  of  the  MBSR  group  versus  the  WL  group  in  revealed  a  significant improvement  in  the  MBSR  ZOOM  group (i-j=3.98,  SE=1.56,  p&lt;0.05, Cohen's  d= 0.92), compared to non-significant change in the MBSR (i-j=2.35, SE=1.57, n.s) and the WL group (ij=0.56, SE=1.09, n.s).

A Univariate analysis for Perceived Stress (PSS) showed non-significant effects. A pairwise comparison of the MBSR group versus the WL group in revealed a significant improvement in the MBSR ZOOM group (i-j=3.90, SE=1.94, p&lt;0.05 , Cohen's d=1.11), a marginally significant improvement in the MBSR group (i-j=3.65, SE=1.95, p=0.06, Cohen's d= 0.89),  compared  to non-significant change in the WL group (i-j=0.99, SE=1.30, n.s). Figure 7 present the effects of pre- to post-intervention measurements for the MBSR, MBSR ZOOM groups versus  the WL control group on several outcome measures.

## 3.2 Long-Term Effectiveness of MBSR and MBSR ZOOM

In  the  next  section  I  will  present  the  results  of  the  follow-up  measurements  for  the variables that came out significant in the comparison between pre and post treatment in the faceto-face and zoom intervention groups separately. These results will be shown in averages and their corresponding graphs. Due to the small number of subjects in these groups, we did not perform statistical tests for the comparison between post and follow-up measurements.

Table 4 and figure 8 presents the descriptive statistics of pre, post intervention and follow up measurements for the MBSR, MBSR ZOOM groups on several outcome measures.

## 3.3 Pre- to Post-treatment Differences Between the CBT, CBT ZOOM and WL groups

Table 5 presents the effects and descriptive statistics for Group X Time comparisons. The variable  perceived  stress  was  considered  as  a  covariate  due  to  initial  differences  found between the groups.

As can be seen in Table 5, A Univariate analysis and a pairwise comparison for FM total score (FIQR) did not reveal significant effects. A Multivariate analysis for FM subscales did not reveal significant effects (Group X Time interaction, Group, Time). A pairwise comparison of the CBT and CBT ZOOM groups versus the WL group revealed a significant improvement in the CBT group only for the Symptoms subscale (i-j=4.16, SE=1.63, p&lt;0.05, Cohen's d= 1.25), compared to non-significant change in the CBT ZOOM group (i-j=1.99, SE=1.95, n.s), and in the WL group (i-j=0.30, SE=1.14, n.s).

Next , we  conducted  Multivariate  analysis  for  the  quality-of-life  subscales  (i.e.  physical, psychological,  social,  and  environmental).  This  test  showed  a  non-significant  interaction  of Group X Time [F(8,86)=1.24, n.s], a significant effect for Time [F(4, 43 )=3.15, p&lt;0.05], or Group [F(8,86)=0.52,  n.s] . In  relation  to  the  different  HRQOL  subscales,  we  found  a  marginally significant interaction of Group X Time with medium effect size in the psychological subscale. A pairwise comparison of the CBT and CBT ZOOM groups versus the WL group revealed a significant improvement in the CBT group in the physical subscale (i-j=-2.21, SE=0.59, p&lt;0.01, Cohen's d= -2.40), the CBT ZOOM group (i-j=-2.18, SE=0.71, p&lt;0.01 , Cohen's d= -1.54) and the WL group (i-j=-1.83, SE=0.60, p&lt;0.05). In the psychological subscale we found a significant improvement in the CBT ZOOM group (i-j=-1.83, SE=0.60, p&lt;0.01, Cohen's d= -1.08), compared to non-significant change in the CBT (i-j=-0.22, SE=0.50, n.s) and WL group (i-j=-0.14, SE=0.33, n.s).

A Univariate analysis of variance and pairwise comparison for major depression (PHQ-9) did not reveal significant effects.

A Univariate analysis for Perceived Stress (PSS) showed non-significant effects for Group X Time interaction or group, in comparison to significant effect for time [F(1,51) =4.75, P&lt; 0.0 5]. A pairwise  comparison  of  the  CBT,  CBT  ZOOM  groups  versus  the  WL  group  in  revealed  a significant  improvement  in  the  CBT  group (i-j=3.28,  SE=1.62,  p&lt;0.05, Cohen's  d= 1.05), compared to marginally significant change in the CBT ZOOM group (i-j=0.72, SE=1.82, p=0.06, Cohen's d= 0.18 ) and non- significant WL group (i-j=1.84, SE=1.12, n.s).

Figure 9 present the effects of pre- to post-intervention measurements for the CBT, CBT ZOOM groups versus  the WL control group on several outcome measures.

## 3.4 Long-Term Effectiveness of CBT and CBT ZOOM

In the next section I will present the results of the follow-up measurements for the variables that came out significant in the comparison between pre and post treatment in the face-to-face and zoom  intervention  groups  separately.  These  results  will  be  shown  in  averages  and  their corresponding graphs. Due to the small number of subjects in these groups, we did not perform statistical tests for the comparison between post and follow-up measurements.

Table  6  and  Figure  10    presents  the  descriptive  statistics  for  pre,  post  and  follow  up measurements in CBT face-to-face and CBT by ZOOM groups.

As you can see in the table and in the graphs, in the CBT group, the measurements at the followup point indicate a continued improvement in the measured symptoms. In the CBT delivered by ZOOM, the results are mixed. While the descriptive of FM symptoms and HRQOL indicates a continued  improvement  after  treatment,  the  results  of  HRQOL  subscales  (physical  and psychological) shows increase in symptoms.

## 4. Potentials Mechanisms of Change

The purpose of this  section  is  to  establish  the  relevance  of  different  mechanisms  to  the physical  and  psychological  aspects  of  FM  and  its  treatment . In  order  to  find  the  relevant mechanisms, we examined the correlations of the change that occurred at the levels of various presumed mechanisms, with the change that occurred in outcome measures follows the different interventions. In other words, we try to find whether there are psychological variables whose change in them related to a greater change in the outcome measures (FM, HRQOL, depression and perceived stress) following treatment (CBT/MBSR).The mechanisms we chose to focus on are difficulties in emotional regulation, pain catastrophizing and psychological inflexibility in pain.  Examining  these  mechanisms  will  allow  us  to  examine  the  significance  of  specific processes for dealing with FM and pain.

First, a score of the change in mechanisms and outcomes was calculated by subtracting the pre-intervention score from the post-intervention score or vice versa (depending on the measure -for  example,  QOL  vs.  perceived  stress),  yielding  a  score  that  represent  the  change  in  the measure throughout the intervention (This score will be marked by the signΔ ( . Subsequently, we  have  conducted  Pearson  correlations  between  all  variables.  The  results  were  calculated separately for the change that occurred in the CBT group and the MBSR group.

It  is  important to note that in all the indices, except for health-related quality of life, the change that occurred was in the form of a decrease, that is, an improvement, therefore a positive relationship indicated a match in the improvement in the indices.

Table  7  presents  Pearson  correlations  among  change  levels  of  FM,  major  depression, perceived  stress,  quality  of  life,  difficulties  in  emotion  regulation,  pain  catastrophizing  and psychological inflexibility in pain in the CBT group.

As presented in Table 7, following CBT, significant positive correlations were found between change in pain cognitions and part of DERS subscales and change in perceived stress. Moreover, we found strong and positive correlation between change in FM and change in Psychological Inflexibility in Pain and a moderate negative correlation between health-related quality of life and Psychological Inflexibility in Pain changes.

Contrary to hypotheses, a positive relationship was found between a change in psychological inflexibility in relation to pain and a change in health-related quality of life and no correlations to change in major depression were found.

Table 8 presents Pearson's correlations among change levels of FM, major depression, perceived stress, quality of life, difficulties in emotion regulation, pain catastrophizing and psychological inflexibility in pain in the MBSR group.

As presented in Table 8, following MBSR,  the change rumination index (Pain Catastrophizing  subscale)  stands  out  with  significant  moderate  relationships  to  depression, perceived  stress  and  psychological  health-related  quality  of  life.  Additionally,  positive moderate correlations were found between change in FM overall impact subscale and changes in pain catastrophizing (total score and helplessness) and fusion (Psychological Inflexibility in Pain subscale).

Relate to  difficulties  in  emotion  regulation,  significant  negative  correlations  were  found between  changes  in  difficulties  in  emotion  regulation  (Inability  to  engage  in  goal  directed behaviors  and  lack  of  emotional  clarity)  and  changes  in  health-related  quality  of  life environmental subscale. Contrary to hypotheses, a positive relationship was found between a change  in  difficulties  in  emotion  regulation  Limited  access  to  effective  emotion  regulation strategies subscale and a change in psychological health related quality of life subscale.

## General Discussion

In the present study, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to examine the effects of CBT and MBSR group therapies for patients with FM , employing a wide variety of measures covering disease-related characteristics, psychopathology, emotion regulation, and pain-related cognitions. For this study, we developed adapted CBT and MBSR protocols specifically suited to meet the unique characteristics, needs, and symptoms of FM . The present study aimed to examine four main research questions:

1. Are  CBT  and  MBSR  effective  for  treating  FM  patients,  as  measured  by  various psychological  (depression,  perceived  stress,  and  quality  of  life)  and  physical  (FM symptoms) outcome measures, compared to a wait-list control group?
2. Are the changes associated with CBT and MBSR stable over time after the end of the intervention?
3. Are  CBT  and  MBSR  treatments  that  are  delivered  online  effective  for  treating  FM patients, as measured by various psychological (depression, perceived stress, and quality of life) and physical (FM symptoms) outcome measures, compared to a wait-list control group?
4. What are the potential mechanisms for the changes that occur during the intervention?

In general, our findings reflect the therapeutic potential of MBSR and CBT for FM patients. In  addition,  MBSR  was  found  to  be  more  effective  in  comparison  to  CBT.  Moreover,  our research indicates that the two treatments have different therapeutic mechanisms and that these affect different symptoms. Our findings highlight the complex connection between the mind and body as well as the extensive and complex distress that FM causes.

## 1. The Effectiveness of CBT and MBSR for FM Patients

In our first hypothesis, we predicted that, in comparison to waitlist control participants, FM patients  receiving  CBT  or  MBSR  would  show  a  greater  reduction  between  pre-  and  post -treatment  assessments  in  different  physical  and  emotional  aspects.  Concerning  MBSR,  this hypothesis was confirmed, indicating that mindfulness-based therapy was highly effective for FM patients. Patients who received MBSR significantly improved in FM, depression, perceived stress,  and  health-related  quality  of  life,  compared  to  patients  in  the  WL  control  group. Regarding CBT, improvements were observed in fewer indices (FM symptoms and the physical aspect of quality of life). These results are in line with a growing body of studies supporting the effectiveness of MBSR in improving the well-being of FM patients (Astin et al., 2003; Fjorback et al., 2013; Goldenberg et al., 1994; Grossman et al., 2007; Schmidt et al., 2011; Sephton et al., 2007).

## 1.1 The Effectiveness of MBSR for FM Patients

The results of our study indicated an improvement in a variety of aspects following MBSR. FM was found to have a significantly greater improvement in the MBSR group compared to the WL group with large effect sizes. It is important to notice that these improvements happened after a 10-week intervention and were stable after 4 months.

Perceived stress also significantly improved from pre- to post-MBSR. Stress reduction is one of the main goals of MBSR, and a variety of therapeutic components focus on dealing with stress. Stress has a key role in FM and often plays a significant part in the vicious cycle in which stressful conditions often lead to a worsening of symptoms, and worsening symptoms often lead to more stress (Van Houdenhove &amp; Egle, 2004). Consequently, an intervention that focuses on

stress, such as MBSR, could help patients slow down and even prevent this cycle. Moreover, such an intervention can help patients avoid being controlled and affected by feelings of stress.

Another  important  finding  of  our  study  was  a  significant  improvement  in  depression following MBSR compared to WL controls. In previous studies, there have been mixed results regarding  the  effectiveness  of  MBSR  on  alleviating  depression,  from  studies  that  did  find MBSR helpful for depression (Astin et al.,2003) to other studies that did not find such an effect (Fjorback et  al.,2013).  Although MBSR is not specifically designed to reduce depression (as opposed to MBCT, another variant of mindfulness-based interventions), it nevertheless does so effectively, as can be seen in the present study. MBSR's effectiveness in reducing depression can likely be explained by the idea that mindfulness allows one to prevent a negative mental and emotional  'drift'  and  to  halt the  escalation  of  negative  thoughts  and  feelings,  which  is characteristic of depression (Clark et al., 2000). Additionally, mindfulness teaches one to shift mental gears, from the mode of a mind dominated by critical and judgmental thinking patterns (which  are  highly  associated  with  depression  as  they  are  likely  to  provoke  and  accelerate downward mood spirals),  to  another  mode  of  mind  in  which  one  can  experience  the  world directly,  non-judgmentally,  and  with  a  more  compassionate  point  of  view.  Finally,  these findings are especially important due to the high comorbidity of FM with depression, which has even been found to be a risk factor for suicidality among FM patients (Aguilera, Paz, Compañ, Medina, &amp; Feixas, 2019;Raphael, Janal, Nayak, Schwartz, &amp; Gallagher, 2006; Wolfe et al., 1995). In fact, it is becoming clear that suicidality itself is a risk factor for this population (Levine &amp; Horesh, 2020); thus, these findings again highlight the importance of holistic interventions like MBSR for treating FM -interventions that do not focus solely on pain, but also affect mood and affective regulation, which could contribute to the well-being of FM patients.

An additional outcome of our study is the effectiveness of MBSR on increasing quality of life. It has been demonstrated that FM patients suffer from greater disability than patients with other chronic pain disorders (Fernández, 2000; Martínez et al., 2003). Our results suggest that MBSR improves health-related quality of life and its physical aspect compared to WL control. Our results support the studies that have found increased quality of life of FM patients following MBSR (Grossmann, Tiefenthaler-Gilmer, Raysz, &amp; Kesper, 2007), rather than studies that did not find this effect (Goldenberg et al.,1994). The physical quality of life relates to the following

symptoms: pain, energy, sleep, mobility, activities, medication, and work. The improvement that occurred following MBSR in quality of life is a very important outcome of our study since this result refers to significant aspects of the patient's daily functioning and thus represents the most direct effect of the disease on the patient's life.

## 1.2 The Effectiveness of CBT for FM Patients

As mentioned before, our study found that CBT led to improvement in FM symptoms and the physical aspect of health-related quality of life. These results are related to many studies that examined CBT for FM patients and showed improvements in pain, quality of life, disability, sleep difficulties, and fatigue associated with the disorder (Bernardy, Klose, Welsch &amp; Häuser, 2019;  Glombiewski  et  al.,  2010). It  is  possible  that  these  improvements  stem  from  CBT's emphasis  on  behavior,  psychoeducation,  and  practice  of  gradual  behavior  change.  CBT addresses FM as the result of a vicious cycle created by behaviors of avoidance and withdrawal from the appearance of pain and emotional distress (Bradley &amp; Alberts, 1999; Keefe et al., 2005). Thus,  it  is  possible  that  CBT's  behavioral  practice  led  to  an  improvement  in  their  physical sensations as patients developed the feeling that their bodies were strong and capable.

On the other hand, our results did not find that CBT leads to improvements in the emotional distress of the patients. This contradicts with the studies that show that CBT reduces the negative mood or depression symptoms associated with FM (Bernardy, Füber, Köllner, &amp; Häuser, 2010, Falcão et al., 2008).

## 1.3 The Comparison between CBT and MBSR

When examining our results, it is important to pay attention to the comparison between the approaches. As can be seen, MBSR led to more improvements compared to CBT, which reflects the significant therapeutic potential of this approach for FM patients above and beyond CBT. These results are not compatible with the meta-analysis studies that compare these interventions and indicate a preference for cognitive-behavioral treatments from the second wave (Albajes &amp; Moix, 2021; Glombiewski et al.. 2010; Kozasa et al., 2012). However, it should be mentioned that these studies did not compare the different treatments directly, and that this type of study has not been done to date.

The difference in results may derive from the fact that the reviews performed examined studies  on  treatments  that  were  not  adjusted  for  the  specific  difficulties  of  FM  patients (Glombiewski et al., 2010). In contrast, our findings regarding the effectiveness of MBSR can possibly be explained by its specific suitability for FM as a result of its inherent mind-body emphasis. In many cases, FM has led to patients' attention and language passing through, or even beginning with, a description of the body. Thus, we speculate that talking through the body, focusing on it, and trying to explore it constitutes a significant starting point for change for these patients. In this regard, it is possible that working through cognition as part of CBT is important, but perhaps not the most effective way to address these patients.

Furthermore,  it  is  possible  that  the  non-judgmental  component  of  mindfulness-based therapy is particularly significant. This population faces a substantial amount of stigma and a common sense of loneliness (Sabik, 2010). The theoretical model of the third wave approaches claims  that  acceptance  must  be  promoted  before  change  (Herbert  &amp;  Forman,  2011).  This understanding in combination with our results may indicate that, in order to help FM patients, it is necessary to focus on the promotion of an accepting and non-judgmental attitude towards the experience before behavioral or cognitive change. It is important to note that CBT does not address these facets of these patients' experience.

Another explanation for the partial results found regarding CBT could be the fact that we used CBT in isolation, rather than as part of a multidisciplinary approach. Previous studies have found the latter to be more effective for FM patients (Bennett &amp; Nelson, 2006). Moreover, our results could be related to certain characteristics of the patients in our specific study (i.e., chronic illness, strength of symptoms, intensity of various emotional difficulties, age, etc.). It is possible that if we divide the patients in our study according to these characteristics, it may be found that some patients benefit more from CBT compared to MBSR. This assumption is based on studies that showed the correlation between patients' characteristics and effectiveness of psychological interventions (Ghaderi, 2006; Sil et al., 2014; Turk, 2005),

Our finding might point to the strength of the adapted protocol used in our study, which gave significant  attention  to  FM  symptoms  through  psychoeducation and practice. This contrasts with the generic protocol used in former studies that applied MBSR to FM patients without modifications that address FM issues specifically; rather, they solely addressed them if brought

up by the patients by chance. The differences between the generic and adapted protocols may also  explain the mixed evidence regarding MBSR research with FM patients (Lauche et al., 2013). In general, there has been a trend of transitioning from generic protocols to populationspecific protocols of MBSR. Upon implementation for other conditions (e.g., breast cancer; Cramer, Lauche, Paul, &amp; Dobod, 2012), this shift has shown great success.

## 2. Differences Between Face-to-Face and Online Therapy

Our  study  was  the  first  to  compare  face-to-face  and  online  videoconferencing  group treatments for FM patients. As mentioned in the introduction, research exists regarding online video  treatments  for  chronic  pain  patients  including  research  specifically  evaluating  CBT (Connolly  et  al.,  2018;  Palyo,  Schopmeyer,  &amp;  McQuaid, 2012;  Taguchi  et  al.,  2021),  and mindfulness-based (Gardner-Nix, Barbati, Grummitt, Pukal, &amp; Raponi Newton, 2014; GardnerNix, Backman, Barbati, &amp; Grummitt, 2018). However, this research has included treatments that are self-guided and not adapted to the unique needs of the patients.

In this section, given the small number of subjects in each group, we performed separate comparisons  for  CBT  and  MBSR.  Based  on  previous  studies  described  in  the  introduction section, we hypothesized that FM patients receiving CBT or MBSR by ZOOM will show greater improvements in FM symptoms, depression, perceived stress, and health-related quality of life between pre- to post-intervention, compared to waitlist (WL) control group.

When we divided the group of MBSR participants between those who participated in therapy online and those who received it face-to-face, we saw that face-to-face therapy led to fewer short-term improvements. Patients who participated in MBSR by ZOOM significantly improved in FM, depression, perceived stress, and health-related quality of life, compared to patients in the WL control group. However, patients who participated in MBSR face-to-face showed improvements only in FM and its overall impact, as well as a marginally significant improvement in perceived stress. Regarding quality of life, improvement was detected only in the physical health-related quality of life. Thus, the MBSR delivered by videoconferencing was found to be more effective in the short term than both the MBSR delivered face-to-face and the WL control group. These results are particularly innovative since only a few studies have been conducted so far on online mindfulness-based therapy for FM patients, the majority of which

solely examined recorded and non-group therapies (Davis &amp; Zatura, 2013; Garrido-Torres et al., 2016).

When examining these results, it is important to refer to the follow-up measurement. In those measurement, we did not perform statistical tests due to the small number of subjects; nevertheless, the trend of change between the time points demonstrates that there is a substantial difference  between  the  stability  of  symptom  intensity  following  online  and  face-to-face treatment.  Although  most  indices  (except  for  the  QOL  subscale)  show  a  more  significant decrease  in  symptoms  between  the  beginning  and  end  of  treatment  for  the  ZOOM  group, improvements between the end of treatment and the follow-up continued only for the group that met face-to-face. This trend may be related to the functional aspect of face-to-face care that requires patients to leave the house. It can be assumed that compliance with this requirement contributes to patients' sense of competence and continued improvement after treatment. This reflects the findings of a study examining pain-related activity management patterns by Mélanie et al. (2018) which also presents less pain interference and better psychological function of the study's  participants  as  significantly  associated  with  the  functionality -focused  practice  of pacing.  This practice is a behavioral strategy used to help individuals schedule their activities based on time or quotas (rather than pain) to maximize their functionality despite persistent pain (Kerns, Sellinger , &amp; Goodin, 2011).

In general, the comparison between CBT conducted face-to-face, over ZOOM, and WL control  group  showed  slightly  higher  therapeutic  potential  for  face-to-face  therapy  over  the latter  groups;  patients  in  the  face-to-face  group  showed  more  improvement  in  their  FM symptoms than the online treatment and WL control group did. Nevertheless, improvements in health-related quality of life and perceived stress were observed in both treatment groups and follow-up trend results did not find significant differences between the treatments either. These results are consistent with other studies that show the effectiveness of CBT delivered through videoconferencing for pain patients (e.g., Connolly et al., 2018; Taguchi et al., 2021), and studies that showed the effectiveness of recorded online CBT therapy. For example, Vallejo et al. (2015) compared  CBT  and  iCBT  for  FM  patients  and  found  an  improvement  in  FM  only  for  the participants  in  the  CBT  face-to-face  group.  Moreover,  the  CBT  and  iCBT  groups  both demonstrated improvement in psychological distress, depression, catastrophizing, and utilizing

relaxation as a coping strategy. Although this study did not use a real time video therapy, it shows the therapeutic potential of online psychological interventions for FM patients.

In conclusion. Our results show mixed evidence regarding the effectiveness of online videoconferencing  psychotherapy,  while  in  MBSR  there  was  a  clear  preference  for  online treatment, in CBT there was a slight advantage for face-to-face treatment. It is important to note the trend of the follow-up results that indicate an advantage for the group that underwent faceto-face MBSR treatment.

A possible explanation for these results could be the adaptation of online treatment to a popular method of communication today. Results from a web-based survey suggest that people may prefer mindfulness internet interventions to in-person therapy: the internet was found to be the first-choice format for 42% of the participants, suggesting that, for many individuals, online MBIs may be an acceptable alternative to face-to-face formats (Wahbeh, Svalina, &amp; Oken, 2014).

On the other hand, there are many writers who emphasize the importance of mutual regulation based on physical presence (Cozolino, 2006; Siegel, 2020). The affective, relational, and regulation mechanisms of change are central to psychotherapy, and they may be lost when treatment shifts online (Weinberg, 2020). Eye contact as well as the pheromones that affect our feelings of intimacy and attachment are lost as well (Cozolino, 2006). The absence of the former aspect is highly relevant for group therapists as it affects therapists' work with group coleade rs as well (Weinberg, 2020). Eye contact is related to attachment and the parasympathetic nervous system, reducing distress and fight -flight reactions (Jarick &amp; Bencic, 2019). It is possible that mindfulness therapy overcomes these challenges of virtual treatment as a result of the joint attention  to  the  body  that  it  manifests  and  its  use  of  recordings  that  increase  the  feeling  of physical togetherness of the participants in the therapy.

Therapeutic presence is defined as bringing one's whole self to the engagement with the client and being fully in the moment with and for the client, with little self-centered purpose or goal in mind (Craig, 1986). Therapists' presence involves a 'being with' the client, rather than a 'doing to' the client. Although there are many distractions when therapy is conducted online, and the barrier of the screen might decrease and dilute the therapist's presence, therapeutic

presence can still be achieved (Craig, 1986). A significant part of mindfulness therapy includes working on the patient ' s ability to be present. The practice of this presence takes place with the cooperation of both the patient and the therapist. It is  possible  that  this  situation  allows  the therapist ' s presence to increase and thus, contributes to the treatment and is also suitable for remote treatment.

A possible explanation for the fact that only a slight difference was observed between face-to-face and ZOOM CBT could be the challenge that both face in addressing exposure and behavioral  tasks.  As  mentioned  before,  for  the  most  part,  online  treatment  allows  for  more gradual exposure and participation in treatment without functional change. However, since CBT includes behavioral tasks and a requirement for functional change, it is more difficult for the patient  participating  in  the  treatment  to  avoid  functioning  even  if  the  treatment  takes  place remotely. To test this explanation, future research should be carried out regarding the effect of behavioral change and the tendency to avoid as mediators or moderators of various treatments' effect.

It is important to remember the possible advantages of online treatment that allow ease and speed of accessibility, the convenience of availability for individual schedules, anonymity, the ability for patients to work at their own pace in the comfort of their own homes, and reduced cost (Andersson &amp; Titov, 2014). On the other hand, it is also important to understand that online group therapy is a vast open space with loose boundaries. Group therapists cannot assume that the confidentiality that is strictly kept in the consulting office will be kept online; therefore, therapists must be much more cautious and take more measures to ensure client confidentiality (Weinberg , 2020). Moreover, since little research has been done in the field of online group therapy, there are many aspects that have not yet been explored. In this context, there is not enough information about the development of the therapeutic alliance in this type of treatment (Weinberg , 2020). There is substantial evidence that the quality of the therapeutic alliance is the best predictor of positive client outcome for all psychotherapies (Martin, Garske, &amp; Davis, 2000; Flückiger, Del Re, Wampold, &amp; Horvath, 2018). The therapeutic alliance has three components: (a) collaborative agreement on the goals of therapy, (b) collaborative agreement on the tasks of therapy, and (c) the emotional bond between the therapist and client (Horvath &amp; Symonds, 1991).

Two of the ingredients of the therapeutic alliance, agreeing on the goals and tasks, can easily be

achieved in online groups. However, it is questionable whether the third component, the quality of the relationship, remains at an equivalent level when conducted online. The absence of bodyto-body interaction in online groups can be a significant, if not the main, obstacle (Weinberg , 2020).  On  the  other  hand,  there  have  been  studies  that  found  that  a  therapeutic  alliance  can develop in video-conference psychotherapy (e.g., Dunn, 2014; Norwood, Moghaddam, Malins, &amp; Sabin-Farrell, 2018; Preschl, Maercker, &amp; Wagner, 2011; Simpson &amp; Reid, 2014). In the study we carried out, the therapeutic alliance was not tested, and it is possible that it was damaged due to the sudden change in the therapeutic plan from face-to-face to online.

In  conclusion,  considering  that  previous  studies  show  a  preference  for  CBT  for  FM patients and given the possible benefits of online treatment (Connolly et al., 2018; Gardner-Nix, Backman, Barbati, &amp; Grummitt, 2018; Taguchi et al., 2021), we recommend conducting future studies that compare the effectiveness of videoconferencing treatments with an active control group, rather than only with control groups that do not receive treatment -as has been done in most studies so far (Bender et al., 2011).

## 3. Potentials Mechanisms of Change in MBSR and CBT

A central goal of this research was to find a psychological treatment that will be tailor-made for FM patients. For this purpose, we adjusted for the complex difficulties of FM patients in the treatment protocol and examined potential change mechanisms for the treatments.

Using an important article by Jensen, Turner, and Romano (2017), we attempted to see the role  of  the  potential  change  mechanisms  in  treatments  in  two aspects:  what  is  the  most significant mechanism in each treatment? and is there a link between specific mechanisms and an improvement in specific symptoms? First, we examined difficulties in emotion regulation as a general mechanism of change in CBT and MBSR. Additionally, we examined the role of two other potential mechanisms  that are related to pain-related cognitions: psychological inflexibility in pain and pain catastrophizing. In this examination we assessed the association between the change in the mechanism (pre- to post-treatment) and the change in several outcome measures: FM, depression, perceived stress, and health-related quality of life.

This study shows that different cognitive and emotional mechanisms have different roles in  promoting  improvement  following  mindfulness  and  CBT  and  in  relation  to  different

symptoms.  Our  findings  show  that  the  most  significant  change  mechanism  for  CBT  was psychological inflexibility in pain, while the most significant mechanism for MBSR was pain catastrophizing. Difficulty in emotion regulation was found to play a less significant role in relation to the two treatments. In addition, the results show that perceived stress has the largest number of connections to the various mechanisms.

## 1.1 The  Relationship  between  Potential  Therapeutic  Mechanisms  and  Outcome Measures

When examining the joint results of the correlation tests for the two groups (CBT and MBSR)  in  relation  to  the  various  physiological  and  emotional  indices  tested,  it  can  be recognized that the variable that stands out in relation to the proposed mechanisms is perceived stress, while the variable to which the fewest relations were found is depression. These results reinforce the studies that claim that FM is a stress-related disorder (Cohen, Kessler, &amp; Gordon, 1995; Sangha, 2000; Staud, 2007) and point to the importance of emphasizing the mechanisms we proposed -specifically, the pain-related mechanisms -for the treatment of the emotional distress accompanying pain among FM patients. Considering the many studies that show the prevalence of depression among FM patients (e.g., Aguglia, Salvi, Maina, Rossetto, &amp; Aguglia, 2011; Arnold et al., 2006), the lack of results for associations between the change in the proposed therapeutic  mechanisms  to  depression  in  this  study  indicates  the  importance  of  conducting future research on the mechanism that will lead to an improvement in mood difficulties.

Furthermore, our study had few results showing correlations between the improvement seen  in  the  outcomes  measures  after  patients  received  MBSR  or  CBT  and  difficulties  in emotional regulation. This suggests that emotional regulation is not a therapeutic mechanism in our study. However, it is possible that the change in emotional regulation caused a change in another mechanism and that the latter led to a change in the results. In addition, it is possible that a change in emotional regulation that focuses on emotional processes and is not expressed through the body or the pain itself is not compatible with the mind-body connection that the patients suffer from.

## 1.2 Potential Therapeutic Mechanisms in MBSR

In relation to MBSR, our study shows the important relationship between the change that  happened  in  pain  catastrophizing  and  the  reduction  in  distress.  Moreover,  we  found

relationships between specific aspects of psychological inflexibility to pain and difficulties in emotion regulation to different outcomes. Compared to the CBT group, few connections were found  between  pain  cognitions  and  emotion  regulation  and  outcomes  measures  among  the participants  in  the  MBSR  group.  Considering  the  significant  improvements  observed  in  the MBSR group, it  can  be  assumed  that  the  proposed  mechanisms  are  not  significant  change mechanisms  in  mindfulness-based  therapy.  It  is  possible  that  the  difficulty  in  finding  a mechanism is related to the complexity of this treatment that works simultaneously on the body and mind. We will now address the results of the associations found in relation to the proposed mechanisms.

## Pain Catastrophizing

In our study we found associations between the change that occurred in pain catastrophizing (total score and helplessness) and FM impact. Moreover, we found associations between the change  that  occurred  in  rumination  and  the  changes  that  occurred  in  depression,  perceived stress, and psychological health-related quality of life. These results consisted with studies that showed the connection between pain catastrophizing and mindfulness (Day, Smitherman, Ward, &amp;Thorn, 2015; Elvery, Jensen, Ehde, &amp; Day, 2017).

Turner and Aaron (2001) suggested that when an individual experiences pain, he/she might switch  into  an  "autopilot"  mode  and  fall  into  a  vicious  cycle  that  amplifies  the  pain.  This "autopilot" mode usually includes automatic catastrophic scenarios that can come into mind when experiencing unavoidable pain. According to our findings, the ability to stop this cycle through reduction in rumination is related to different physical and emotional symptoms.  It seems that mindfulness practice may help in doing so by allowing one to return to the present moment and avoid being caught up in imaginary future disastrous events (Kabat-Zinn, 1994).

In  addition,  the  questionnaire  we  used  places  significant  emphasis  on  the  individual's reactivity  to  stimuli  and,  specifically,  to  pain.  Considering  this,  our  results  concluded  that change in reactivity was significantly related to change in the effect of the disorder. This result is  consistent  with  the  theory  underlying  mindfulness-based  treatments,  in  which  there  is  an attempt to promote the ability to accept things as they are without trying to change them (KabatZinn, 1994).

## Psychological Inflexibility in Pain

Psychological  flexibility  in  pain  refers  to  the  capacity  to  observe  pain  from  a  more neutral perspective, with the ability to recognize and accept pain (as opposed to avoiding it) without being caught up with it (Sullivan, Bishop, &amp; Pivik, 1995).

We found that following MBSR, the change in cognitive fusion with pain was related to the change in FM impact, and the change in avoidance was related to the change in perceived stress. These results are important considering studies have found a highly common tendency among FM patients to develop an avoidance from pain sensations and attempt to exert control over  pain  (Van  Koulil  et  al.,  2008).  The  finding  regarding  avoidance  supports  the  theory underlying mindfulness therapy, which claims that deliberate attempts to suppress thoughts and feelings can increase their occurrence and behavioral impact (Cioffi &amp; Holloway, 1993; Clark, Ball, &amp; Pape, 1991; Wegner, Schneider, Carter, &amp; White, 1987) as well as the attempt of this theory to promote acceptance. In addition, it acknowledges the uncontrollable nature of certain stressors  and  focuses  on  the  aspects  that  can  be  controlled  such  as  viewing  psychological reactions to external events as understandable and transient rather than as unbearable conditions that must be avoided ) Casale et al., 2019).

The paucity of associations found in our study between the change in psychological flexibility  in  pain  and  actual  change  in  outcome  measures  following  mindfulness-based treatment  points  to  a  gap  between  the  third  wave  theory  that  emphasizes  the  place  of psychological flexibility in treatment and its actual effect for FM patients after MBSR. This gap reflects the need for additional studies that examine the place of psychological flexibility in third wave treatments and the possibility that MBSR works through a change in other mechanisms.

## Difficulties in Emotion Regulation

We found significant associations between changes that occurred in the environmental health-related  quality  of  life  and  part  of  these  aspects  of  difficulties  in  emotion  regulation: changes in inability to engage in goal-directed behaviors, and lack of emotional clarity. In our study, the tests conducted among the MBSR participants showed non-significant associations

between the total score of difficulties in emotion regulation and the physical and emotional outcomes.

Environmental health-related quality of life refers to financial resources, physical safety, health, and social care. Thus, most of the actions described under this variable relate to external components  of  patients'  lifestyle. Fibromyalgia  symptoms  cause  significant  distress  and discomfort that influence daily life  considerably, including  habits  and  routines  (Henriksson, Gundmark, Bengtsson, &amp; Ek, 1992). Therefore, finding a therapeutic process that will contribute to a change in their external living environment, such as emotional regulation in this study, is extremely  significant.  In  addition,  this  type  of  therapeutic  process  includes  cooperation  or dependence on another individual, meaning that it requires the ability to communicate with another. It is possible that an improvement in emotional regulation contributes to the ability to communicate  with  another.  This  relates  to  the  studies  that  show  that  emotion  regulation influences the ability to communicate with others (Galvez-Sánchez, Reyes del Paso, &amp; Montoro, 2022;  Klein,  Renshaw,  &amp;  Curby,  2016;  Martínez-González,  Cervin,  &amp;  Piqueras,  2022). Furthermore,  it  is  possible  that  an  improvement  in  emotional  regulation  contributes  to  the motivation to communicate with another for self-advancement.

## Potential Therapeutic Mechanisms in CBT

As mentioned earlier, the most prominent mechanism found in CBT for FM patients was psychological inflexibility in pain. We will now address the results of the associations found in relation to the proposed mechanisms.

## Psychological Inflexibility in Pain

In our study we found that among patients who participated in CBT, the most significant mechanism was psychological inflexibility in pain. The change in psychological inflexibility in pain was related to the change in FM, FM symptoms, perceived stress, and health-related quality of life.  These  results  are  consistent  with  the  growing  evidence that  psychological flexibility modulates the relation between severity of the disease and the impact of FM symptoms (Vallejo et al., 2021). Considering the above, these results are particularly innovative and important as they indicate the significance of a change in psychological flexibility in pain.

This  results  can  be  explained  in  relation  to  the  behavioral  change  emphasized  as  a therapeutic goal. Thus, the practice of behavioral change as well as the learning and practice of separating  emotion,  thought,  and  behavior  included  in  CBT  correspond  to  psychological flexibility.  The  essence  of  psychological  flexibility  represents  one's  ability  to  directly  and openly  get  in  touch  with  experiences  in  the  present  moment  as  well  as  the  maintenance  or changing of behavior according to what the situation affords and according to one's personal goals and values (Bond, Flaxman, &amp; Bunce, 2008; Hayes et al., 2006).

Moreover, we found that the change in pain avoidance was related to the change in FM and FM symptoms, while the change in pain fusion was related to the change in perceived stress, and  health-related  quality  of  life.  These  results  support  studies  that  show  that  avoidance behavior is related to symptom severity and disability in the FM population (Nijs et al., 2013). In addition, the significance of pain fusion to perceived stress and quality of life points out the importance of separating the sense of self from the sense of pain in order to reduce anxiety and improve the effects of disease and health interventions on the individual's quality of life . This result might be explained by a metacognitive capacity called "Decentering". This term refers to the ability to observe one's thoughts and feelings as temporary, subjective events in the mind, as opposed to objective reflections of the self that are necessarily true (Safran &amp; Segal, 1990). Thus, working on more flexible cognitive patterns that create a separa tion between 'me and the pain' might be more beneficial for patients with initial higher cognitive fusion with pain.

Casale and colleagues ( 2019 ) claims that cognitive flexibility plays a central role in the ability to prevent stress-induced depressive and anxiety disorders. The authors link cognitive flexibility and resilience to positive explanatory style which is exhibited by people who do not automatically blame themselves or others for a difficulty. Instead, they see it as a temporary problem that only affects limited areas of their life and possess the ability to reframe experiences in a more positive light. CBT emphasizes the ability to reframe experiences, which may thereby promote cognitive flexibility, an ability that is so important for patients who suffer from various cognitive difficulties (Bertolucci &amp; de Oliveira, 2013).

## Pain Catastrophizing

Pain  catastrophizing  is  defined  as  "a  cognitive  and  emotional  state  where  patients magnify the threat value of a pain stimulus in the context of pain  and  are unable to inhibit intrusive pain-related thoughts" (Sullivan &amp; Bishop, 1995).

In  our  study,  the  associations  found  among  CBT  participants  showed  relationships between the change that occurred in pain catastrophizing during therapy and perceived stress. These results are in line with studies that show that the links between pain and emotional distress (depression and anxiety) were mediated by catastrophizing (Lami , Martínez, Miró, Sánchez, &amp; Guzmán, 2018; Neves et al., 2023). On the other hand, in our study we did not find that pain catastrophizing was correlated with the change in depression. This contrasts with studies that indicate that depression and catastrophizing are constructs that exert their detrimental effects via  multiple,  overlapping  pathways  (Edwards  et  al.,  2011)  and,  that  reductions  in  pain catastrophizing after receiving CBT are related to reductions in depressive symptoms(Burns, Day, &amp;Thorn, 2012).

In addition, we found that in the CBT group, the change in helplessness was related to the change in perceived stress. Previous research has demonstrated the significance of feelings of helplessness in FM. For example, one study found that helplessness partially mediated the effects of pain on coping and depression (Nicassio, Radojevic, Schoenfeld-Smith, &amp; Dwyer, 1995). Furthermore, Nicassio and colleagues (1999) reported that helplessness partially mediated the effects of both pain and disability on depressive symptoms. In addition, there are studies that show the connection between a feeling of helplessness and stress among patients with rheumatic diseases (Mills, Azizoddin, Gholizadeh, Racaza, &amp; Nicassio, 2018). CBT treatment includes the practice of behavioral change and thus, allows a gradual return to function, promoting the sense of competence that has been lost for patients with FM.

Combining these studies  together  with  the  results  of  our  study,  one  may  notice  the importance of conducting future research regarding the role of pain catastrophizing in CBT for FM patients.  Since  the  studies  carried  out  so  far  mainly  refer  to  depression  as  an  outcome measure, while our study notes the importance of catastrophizing to improve perceived stress instead, we recommend that future studies examine the effect of CBT on various emotional and cognitive measures.

## Difficulties in Emotion Regulation

As can be seen, emotional regulation  showed the fewest  relationships  to  changes  in outcome measures following CBT compared to the other mechanisms tested in the study. The tests among the CBT participants showed non-significant associations between the changes in the total score of difficulties in emotion regulation and the physical and emotional outcomes. Nevertheless,  we  found  significant  associations  between  changes  in  perceived  stress  and changes in part of these aspects of difficulties in emotion regulation: non -acceptance of negative emotions,  inability  to  engage  in  goal-directed  behaviors,  and  lack  of  emotional  awareness. These results support studies that show the different role of specific abilities that characterize emotional regulation among FM patients (Frumer, Marom Harel, &amp; Horesh, 2023;Molinari et al., 2020; Trucharte et al., 2020).

Research comparing the presence of emotional processing in CBT with other therapeutic modalities  has  revealed  conflicting  findings.  While  some  researchers  have  reported  no difference in emotional processing outcome between and CBT and other approaches (Coombs, Coleman and Jones, 2002; Jones and Pulos, 1993), others have reported that experiential and psychodynamic therapies facilitate emotional processing more effectively than CBT (Rudkin, Llewelyn, Hardy, Stiles and Barkham, 2007; Watson and Bedard, 2006). There are writers that suggested that a shortcoming of CBT may be the tendency to 'intellectualize' the emotional experience  by  adopting  a  more  instructional,  as  opposed  to  explorative  approach  (Mackay, Barkham, Stiles and Goldfried, 2002). This is supported by evidence from studies revealing that long verbal interventions and therapist interactions infused with a high incidence of cognitive speech were found to be negatively related  to  emotional  processing  and  treatment  outcome (Anderson, Bein, Pinnell and Strupp, 1999; Wiser and Goldfried, 1998). This explanation can be particularly relevant for fibromyalgia patients who suffer from various cognitive difficulties (Bell et al., 2018).

Another explanation can be related to the tool we chose to measure emotional regulation. As mentioned earlier, emotional regulation is a broad concept that has different references and definitions among different researchers (Gratz &amp; Roemer, 2004). It is possible that if we had chosen to measure emotional regulation techniques, we would have seen different results.

## Importance and Contribution of the Study, Limitations, and Future Directions

This  study  conducted  a  broad  examination  of  CBT  and  MBSR  using  a  variety  of physical,  psychological,  and  cognitive  measures  to  examine  the  effectiveness  and  the mechanisms of change of the interventions among FM patients. This study has several potential limitations, one of them being the administration of self-report questionnaires, which may have been subject to reporting and memory biases. Another limitation of this study is the combination of a modest sample size and a considerable number of outcomes. Thus, this study may have been  somewhat  underpowered  to  detect  some  important  effects.  Additionally,  most  of  the participants in the study were women, according to our population statistics. Still, it will be interesting to examine whether CBT and MBSR have a different impact on men than women with FM. In the current study there were not enough male participants to conduct this kind of examination. Moreover, when examining medical conditions, the addition of physiological data may be highly important. No physiological measures (such as heart rate, skin conductance, or blood tests) were collected in this study. Such a study could be carried out in the future. Finally, our research was carried out during the outbreak of COVID-19. This period has been studied and proven to have a negative psychological impact on individuals (Talevi et al., 2020) and that female gender was related to higher levels of psychological distress in this time (Horesh, Kapel, &amp; Hasson -Ohayon, 2020). Thus, it is possible that the subjects in the study experienced higher levels of mental distress than usual due to the timing of the measurements and treatment, which may be difficult to distinguish from the results of the study . Furthermore, since the recruitment for the groups that participated in online treatment was carried out after the outbreak of the Corona  virus  while  the  recruitment  for  the  face-to-face  groups  was  carried  out  before  the outbreak of the epidemic, the lack of findings in the comparison of the groups in the baseline indices partially answers the question of whether there is a difference in the level of distress, but it is possible that the difference is expressed in indices that were not tested. In addition, in this study, we examined mechanisms of change by measuring the change between pre- and posttreatment. This examination did not enable us to establish a timeline for cause and effect. This is a known problem in the research field of therapeutic mechanisms (Kazdin, 2009). Furthermore, the control group is of the waiting group type and does not include treatment as usual or other patient populations. Moreover, we recommend that future studies will examine the question of 'what works for whom', That is, an  attempt to examine whether there are characteristics of illness, emotional distress or practice abilities, which are related to a greater benefit following cognitive behavioral therapy or mindfulness-based therapy.

Despite these limitations, our study was the first to conduct a direct comparison between approaches with different therapeutic philosophies for FM patients. Our findings have clinical importance. They point to the unique potential of CBT and MBSR to alleviate the distress of FM patients using a group intervention characterized by high cost-effective value (i.e., group setting, short period, online intervention). The results reveal the significant therapeutic potential of MBSR for FM (face-to-face and online) above and beyond CBT and thus, the importance of a psychological intervention with a holistic approach to body and mind for FM patients. The most innovative and significant results concern the effectiveness of MBSR delivered online (using the ZOOM application). Due to the small number of subjects, the trend of follow-up results, and the results showing better outcomes among the group that received CBT, further research is required to understand the effectiveness of this method.

While there is growing evidence for the effectiveness of psychological interventions in stress-related, pain-inducing physical illnesses, most studies in this area are still quite basic in their  design,  methodology, and measures. Considering the scarcity of studies examining the mechanisms underlying CBT and MBSR for FM patients, the present study concentrated on bridging these gaps, focusing on the understanding of mechanisms of change which have been hypothesized to play a role in relieving the symptoms associated with the disorder. Our research points to differences in the role of cognitive and emotional processes in the different treatments and in relation to different symptoms. This indicates that the treatments do not work in the same way  and  that  it  is  important  in  further  research  to  understand  the  way  the  treatments  and therapists work in the different approaches. This study revealed that there are two important therapeutic components which are pain-related cognitions. Psychological inflexibility in pain and pain catastrophizing are both well-known and important cognitive processes in FM patients (Baastrup et al., 2016; Gracely et al., 2004). Our results suggest that psychological inflexibility in  pain  serves  as  a  key  mechanism  in  CBT,  while  pain  catastrophizing  serves  as  a  key mechanism underlying MBSR, affecting relief in FM symptoms and its accompanying mental distress. Moreover, our study indicates that difficulties in emotion regulation did not serve as an important  mechanism.  This  information  points  to  significant  therapeutic  targets  for  those treating FM, allowing professionals to focus on the most significant aspects, as opposed to the less significant ones.

Furthermore,  the  attempt  to  create  "tailor-made"  treatments  for  FM  patients  has important  implications  concerning  the  therapeutic  and  management  options  offered  to  this population. Chronic patients often feel powerless or too exhausted to take a part in long and extensive  therapeutic  programs  (Brintz,  Roth,  Faurot,  Rao,  &amp;Gaylord,  2020).  They  often withdraw from therapy, which might result in only short-term improvement or no improvements whatsoever (Glombiewski et al., 2010). Thus, those who suffer from FM are in great need of therapeutic  programs  that  are  as  short  and  efficient  as  possible  and  enable  cooperation  and adherence.

Finally, our research focuses on FM: the "invisible illness", the disorder for which no causality or cure has yet been found. Referring to various physical, cognitive, and emotional indicators, as well as comparing the two most popular psychological treatments for this disorder, our  research  expands  the  knowledge  regarding  the  phenomenon  that  many  researchers  and clinicians deny. We hope that many will be exposed to this research and that it will contribute to the validation of this disorder's existence as well as the inspiration of further research that reduces the related stigma and helps alleviate the distress of FM patients.

## Appendix 4 - Comparison of Baseline Demographic and Physical Characteristics between the face-to-face and ZOOM interventions

The second comparison we made included 63 FM patients that were randomly assigned to either the CBT group (n=15), CBT Zoom group (n=16), or the WL control group (n=32). The sample ranged in age from 20 to 74 years (mean ±SD: 49.18±12.63 years). To ensure that there were no significant differences between groups following randomization, all the variables in this study were compared at baseline. Table 2 presents patient demographic characteristics.

As presented in Table 2, One way Anova and chi-square/Fisher tests for independence demonstrated that there were no significant differences between the CBT, CBT ZOOM and the WL  groups  on  demographic  measures.  In  addition,  there  were  no  significant  differences

between the groups in baseline clinical measures FM (FIQR) [F(64)=1.31, n.s], major depression (PHQ)  [F(64)=1.15  n.s],  health  related  quality  of  life  (HRQOL)  [F(64)=0.36,  n.s],  expect  for perceived stress (PSS) [F(64)=5.05 p&lt;0.01].

The second comparison we made included 62 FM patients that were randomly assigned to either the  MBSR group (n=13),  MBSR Zoom group (n=17),  or the  WL  control  group  (n=33).

In  addition,  there  were  no significant differences between  the groups  in baseline  clinical  measures-  FM  (FIQR) [F(60)=0.07, n.s],perceived stress (PSS) [F(60)=1.04 n.s], major depression (PHQ) [F(60)=0.35 n.s], quality of life (HRQOL) [F(60)=0.35, n.s].

## תקציר

: מבוא פיברומיאלגיה היא מחלה ראומטית, הפרעת כאב ה . פוגעת בעיקר בנשים פיברומיאלגיה מאופיינת בכאבי  שרירים  ושלד  ספונטניים  כרוניים  ונרחבים,  וה יא נלוו ית , להפרעות  סומטיות  תפקודיות אחרות תחושות  גופניות  שליליות  באיברים  ובמערכות  פיזיולוגיות  שונות,  עייפות  כרונית  ותפקוד  לקוי.  חולי פיברומיאלגיה מדווחים על שיעורים גבוהים יחסית של הפרעות פסיכיאטריות, במיוחד הפרעות מתח ומצב רוח, כמו גם ליקויים קוגניטיביים וירידה כללית באיכות חייהם. עד היום לא נמצא טיפול תרופתי או רגשי מיטבי  לחולי  פיברומיאלגיה.  טיפול  קוגניטיבי  התנהגותי  וטיפול מבוסס  מיינדפולנס  הם  שני  הטיפולים הפסיכולוגיים  המומלצים  והפופולאריים  בקרב  מטופלים  אלו. טיפול  קוגניטיבי  התנהגותי  מבוסס  על התיאוריה שמערכת האמונות הבסיסית של האדם לגבי עצמו וה העולם מייצרת מחשבות לא תפקודיות , שבתורן תורמות לרגשות שליליים ולהתנהגויות לא אדפטיביות. התערבות זו כוללת ניסיון לשנות קוגניציות והתנהגויות על מנת להפחית תגובות רגשיות לא הסתגלותיות , . בכאב כרוני CBT יציע פרקטיקות נפשיות ופיזיות המתמקדות במחשבות כמו קטסטרופיזציה ומחשבות שליליות על ה  יכולת או העתיד, ובהתנהגויות . כמו הימנעות , בנוסף המטפל ילמד את המטופלים לבצע תרגילים להרגעת רגשות שליליים כמו הרפיית שרירים  להפחתת  חרדה.  מיינדפולנס  כרוך  ב"תשומת  לב  בדרך  מסוימת:  בכוונה,  ברגע  הנוכחי,  וללא ." שיפוטיות השיטה מנסה לקדם מודעות ותשומת לב על בסיס מרגע לרגע. איכות המודעות שהתערבות זו מנסה לקדם כוללת פתיחות, סקרנות ויחס לא שיפוטי עם דגש על ראייה וקבלת דברים כפי שהם מבלי לנסות לשנותם. המחקר שלנו כלל התערבות מסוג MBSR , פרוטוקול מיינדפולנס המתמקד במתח ונמצא כיעיל לחולי כאב. ניתן לסכם את ההבדל המהותי בין הטיפולים כך בעוד שטיפול קוגניטיבי התנהגותי מקדם שינוי בתפיסת הכאב, מיינדפולנס יקדם קבלה של חווית הכאב. מחקרים לגבי יעילות הגישות לחולי פיברומיאלגיה הצביעו על תוצאות מעורבות ומחקרי מטה  -אנליזה שהשוו בין הגישות הראו יתרון לטיפולים התנהגותיים קוגניטיביים. בנוסף, רו , ב המחקרים בחנו רק את התוצאות (ולא את התהליך) של ההתערבויות תוך התמקדות בשינויים כלליים שחלו בין תחילת וסוף ההתערבות. לכן, לא הרבה ידוע על איך הטיפולים פועל  ים , ואילו מנגנונים אחראים לשינויים בתסמינים המדווחים על ידי מטופלים בעקבות טיפולים. לבסוף רוב  המחקרים  הקודמים  השתמשו  בפרוטוקול  הגנרי , ים  של  הטיפולים שאינם מתחשבים בקשיים הקוגניטיביים והתפקודיים העצומים שיש לחולי . פיברומיאלגיה

: מטרות המחקר המחקר הנוכחי נועד לגשר על פערים במחקר בנוגע לטיפולים השונים באמצעות בחינה מקיפה של יעילות ההתערבויות, תוך שימוש בפרוטוקול טיפול חדש ומותאם המיועד לחולי פיברומיאלגיה, יחד עם מגוון של סימפטומטיים, פסיכולוגיים, ומדדים קוגניטיביים. ציפינו שההתערבויות יהיו מועילות עבור חולי פיברומיאלגיה בכך שישפרו היבטים סימפטומטיים , , כמו גם היבטים פסיכולוגיים, כגון דיכאון

מתח נתפס כללי ואיכות חיים. מטרה נוספת של המחקר הנוכחי הייתה לבחון את התהליכים שבבסיס הטיפולים  השונים על  ידי  זיהוי  המנגנונים  האחראים  לשינוי  בתסמיני  המטופל.  התמקדנו  במנגנונים : קוגניטיביים פוטנציאליים של שינוי 1 ) קשיים בוויסות רגשות 2 ) חוסר גמישות פסיכולוגית הקשורה לכאב )3 קטסטרופיזציה של כאב. שיערנו כי יכולת וויסות רגשי, כמו גם השינוי בקוגניציות הקשורות לכאב, יהיו אחראים לשינוי במשתני התוצאה.

שיטה : המחקר הנוכחי הינו מחקר קליני מבוקר עם רנדומיזציה (Randomized-Controlled Trial) , שכלל 93 חולי פיברומיאלגיה שחולקו  ל3 קבוצות -טיפול  קוגניטיבי  התנהגותי,  טיפול  מבוסס  מיינדפולנס ורשימת  המתנה (עם  הקצאה  מאוחרת  לטיפול) שהיוותה  קבוצת  ביקורת . המחקר  שלנו  נערך  במהלך התפרצות  מגפת  הקורונה COVID-19 , מצב  שאילץ  להתאים  את  ההתערבויות  הטיפוליות לפלטפורמה ( מקוונת (באמצעות אפליקציית זום). המעבר הזה אפשר לנו להשוות את ההשפעה של טיפולים CBT, MBSR ) כאשר הם מועברים פנים אל פנים ובאופן מקוון על ידי ועידת וידאו. : המחקר כלל שלוש מדידות טרום התערבות, לאחר התערבות  ו מדידת מעקב של 4 חודשים. המשתתפים מילאו שאלוני דיווח עצמי שהעריכו פיברומיאלגיה,  איכות  חיים  הקשורה  לבריאות,  מתח  נתפס  ודיכאון  מג'ורי.  בנוסף,  גורמים . קוגניטיביים הוערכו, לרבות חוסר גמישות פסיכולוגית בכאב, קטסטרופה של כאב וקשיים בוויסות רגשות תוצאות : הממצאים שלנו משקפים את הפוטנציאל הטיפולי של טיפול מבוסס מיינדפולנס וטיפול קוגניטיבי התנהגותי עבור חולי פיברומיאלגיה. בהשוואת הגישות, טיפול מבוסס מיינדפולנס נמצא יעיל יותר עבור . חולים אלו מטופלים שקיבלו התערבות מבוססת מיינדפולנס השתפרו משמעותית בפיברומיאלגיה , , דיכאון מתח נתפס ואיכות חיים הקשורה לבריאות, בהשוואה לחולים בקבוצת הביקורת הביקורת , . מצד שני בקרב המשתתפים  בטיפול  קוגניטיבי  התנהגותי,  נצפו  שיפורים  רק  במדדים  בודדים  (תסמיני  פיברומיאלגיה וההיבט הפיזי של איכות החיים). שיפורים אלו התרחשו לאחר התערבו  ת של 10 שבועות והיו יציבים לאחר 4 , חודשים פרט למדד איכות חיים בעקבות טיפול מבוסס מיינדפולנס . יתרה מכך, ההשוואה בין טיפול קוגניטיבי התנהגותי , הניתן פנים אל פנים טיפול קוגניטיבי התנהגותי המועבר באפליקציית זום וקבוצת הביקורת הראתה פוטנציאל טיפולי גבוה יותר לטיפול פנים אל פנים, בעוד שהתערבות מבוססת מיינדפולנס המועברת אונליין נמצאה  יעילה יותר  מה  התערבות  ה  מועברת פנים  אל  פנים  ומ , קבוצת ביקורת. בנוסף תוצאות המחקר מצביעות על קיומה של דיפרנציאציה בתפקידם של המנגנונים שנבדקו ביחס לטיפולים ולמדדי  תוצאה  השונים.  הממצאים  שלנו  מראים  שמנגנון  השינוי  המשמעותי  ביותר  בטיפול קוגניטיבי התנהגותי היה  חוסר  גמישות  פסיכולוגית  בכאב,  בעוד  שהמנגנון  המשמעותי  ביותר  לטיפול מבוסס מיינדפולנס היה קטסטרופיזציה של כאב. לעומת זאת, תוצאות המחקר מצביעות על כך שלקושי בוויסות רגשי היה תפקיד פחות משמעותי ביחס לשני הטיפולים. בנוסף, התוצאות מראות שמדד התוצאה הבולט ביחס למנגנוני השינוי שנבדקו הוא לחץ נתפס.

מסקנות  ודיון: המחקר הנוכחי הוא הראשון שהשווה  בין שתי התערבויות פסיכולוגיות עם פילוסופיות טיפוליות שונות עבור חולי פיברומיאלגיה. מחקר זה מדגיש את הפוטנציאל של טיפול מבוסס מיינדפולנס (המועבר פנים אל פנים ובאופן מקוון) לטיפול במחלות המאופיינות בהיבטים דומיננטיים של גוף -נפש, מעל ומעבר לטיפול  קוגניטיבי התנהגותי . מחקר זה תורם להבנה מעמיקה יותר של הטיפולים הפסיכולוגים השונים עבור חולי פיברומיאלגיה על ידי יצירת פרוטוקול הולם , ועל ידי בחינת מגוון רחב של היבטים סימפטומטיים,  פסיכולוגיים  וקוגניטיביים.  מחקר  זה  סייע  לשפוך  אור  נוסף  על  המרכיבים  הטיפוליים החשובים, שעשויים לשמש כמנגנונים האחראים לשינוי, במהלך הטיפול ובעקבותיו. נראה שהיכולת לקבל את המצוקה של האדם, במקום להילחם בה, חשובה מאוד עבור . חולי פיברומיאלגיה יתרה מכך, נראה שכאשר המטופל מצליח לגלות גמישות רבה יותר מול הכאב, ובמיוחד כאשר הוא מצליח להתייחס אליו . בצורה פחות קטסטרופלית או תגובתית, כך בריאותו הנפשית משתפרת בעקבות הטיפול
